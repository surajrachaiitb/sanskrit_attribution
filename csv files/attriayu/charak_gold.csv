Besides, his inordinate attention to just one wife in comparison to the others resulted in his not being able to satisfy the desires of his remaining wives – all of whom were the daughters of Daksha Prajapati (Lord of Progeny). This ill-treatment to his daughters made Daksha furious, and his anger came out of his mouth in the form of breath that took a physical form (Yakshma). The now lusterless, afflicted Moon sought clemency from the great Daksha, accompanied by the Gods and Sages. "

Normally, the dhatus of the body get metabolised (being acted upon) by their own ushmas or dhatvagnis (transforming enzymes in the tissue elements). From these dhatus, (nutrient tissue elements), the other dhatus ( next dhatu to it that which receive nourishment) gets nourished through their respective srotas (channels of circulation). (For example, a poshaka rasa dhatu would nourish the rakta dhatu ).   Once, however, there is any obstruction to srotas or if there is diminution of stable tissue elements like rakta or if there is diminution of dhatu-ushmas or dhatvagnis then rajayakshma is manifested. In such a case, whatever food is digested in the gastrointestinal tract by jatharagni is mostly reduced to waste products and very little of it contributes to the formation of ojas (nourishment). The patient is depleted of all tissue elements and strength. The patient’s stool should be preserved and it is the only source of strength left with him. Because of the obstruction to the srotas, rasa dhatu becomes vidagdha (improperly metabolized) in its own location (heart) and this vitiated rasa comes out through the upper passages in different forms by way of coughing. Subsequently, six or eleven symptoms (or forms of diseases) are manifested, and their aggregation is the syndrome called rajayakshma. Cough, distress in shoulder, change of voice, fever, pain in flanks, headache, vomiting of rakta and kapha, dyspnea, diarrhea and anorexia are the eleven symptoms of rajayakshma ; or they are also six viz., cough, fever, pain in flanks, hoarseness of voice diarrhea and anorexia. With eleven, six or even three of the symptoms, a patient is incurable if he is losing mamsa (flesh tissues) and strength, but he is curable if he is behaving otherwise in spite of showing all the symptoms.
