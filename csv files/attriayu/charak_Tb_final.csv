At that time, fire within consumes whatever food is stored inside, turning it into waste. This is its inherent characteristic. Therefore, stool must be carefully protected, especially during times of illness, for a person who is already weakened by loss of bodily tissues cannot afford to lose any more strength. When the channels are blocked, rasa (nutrient fluid) located in its proper place gets cooked and gives rise to various diseases like diarrhea, indigestion, etc. These diseases manifest differently based on their causes: cough, thirst, loss of luster, fever, pain in the sides or head, vomiting, anorexia, fainting, and other symptoms that result from imbalance in bodily tissues. Anyone who exhibits these symptoms should be treated carefully, as they can lead to various diseases caused by imbalance in bodily tissues.

Once the phlegm has melted due to the heat, it begins to flow through the channels, just as the snow melts in sunlit parts of a mountain. When the phlegm, thus stimulated, starts flowing, feed the person with a delicious and nourishing meal of fish or pork or fresh milk.
