Explanation: In this verse, the Lord describes how a person who is knowledgeable in scripture should approach the various forces of defect, illness, fire, and strength that have been combined by Him at an appropriate time.

""Mayā"" indicates that it is the Lord who has combined them, and ""kriyoktā"" means created or brought into existence. The person should discriminate between these separate forces with a united intellect, denoted by ""sammasyabuddhyā,"" and then employ them as needed, indicated by ""prayojayet."" This is to be done with constant scriptural study, represented by ""chāstravid pramattaḥ.""",

They are commonly regarded as being difficult to defeat when they become severe and take on a destructive form, similar to the venomous bites of serpents. (10-11)

Excessive dryness caused by Vata, Pitta located in improper places, or the depletion of bodily tissues due to an imbalance in Kapha can lead to disease. Similarly, engaging in activities that are contrary to one's nature, such as excessive exertion or eating foods that are difficult to digest, and consuming food at the wrong time or in improper combinations can also cause disease. (12-13)

Exposure to cold weather, wind, or excessive heat, as well as the overconsumption of sour and salty foods, can lead to an increase in Pitta, resulting in diseases such as skin rashes and itchiness. On the other hand, exposure to hot weather, excessive exercise, or the consumption of spicy and dry foods can aggravate Vata, leading to conditions such as joint pain and stiffness. (14-15)

The imbalance of Kapha can result in the production of mucus in the lungs, congestion, and respiratory issues. The overconsumption of sweet, sour, and salty foods, or food that is difficult to digest, can cause an increase in Kapha and lead to various diseases. (16)

Therefore, it is important to maintain a balanced lifestyle and diet, avoiding activities and substances that can aggravate the doshas and lead to disease. Regular detoxification and rejuvenation therapies, as well as seasonal routines, are also recommended to keep the doshas in balance and promote optimal health. (17)",

The diet should consist of easily digestible and nourishing food items, including grains like wheat and barley, along with ghee, in order to balance vata dosha.",
