1,"Now we shall expound the chapter “Rajayakshma Chikitsa""(Management of Wasting Diseases). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the ancient Indian medical science of Ayurveda, Lord Atreya's teachings have been revered for their wisdom and insight. One such chapter that has garnered significant attention is ""Rajayakshma Chikitsa,"" or the Management of Wasting Diseases. This chapter, which holds immense significance in Ayurvedic literature, provides a comprehensive guide to treating diseases that cause wasting, or excessive weight loss and weakness, in the body. In this article, we will delve deep into the teachings of this chapter, elucidating the causes, symptoms, and treatments of wasting diseases, as described in Lord Atreya's enlightening discourses. Join us as we explore this fascinating subject and deepen our understanding of Ayurvedic medicine and its timeless wisdom."
2,"The following story – of Chandrama (Moon)’s passionate cohabiting (with Rohini, one of his 28 celestial wives)  - was narrated by the Gods to the sages. ","In the rich tapestry of Indian mythology, a captivating tale woven by the divine entities for the wise sages is the story of Chandrama and his ardent cohabitation with Rohini, his celestial wife among the 28. A vivid narrative, filled with lessons and symbolism, this account provides a unique insight into the complex and intriguing relationships between the heavenly bodies and their celestial companions, as imagined in ancient Indian traditions."
3,"Because of his excessive sexual indulgence with Rohini, Chandrama soon started neglecting his own health, becoming emaciated due to depletion of his bodily unctuousness (essence or vitality). Besides, his inordinate attention to just one wife in comparison to the others resulted in his not being able to satisfy the desires of his remaining wives – all of whom were the daughters of Daksha Prajapati (Lord of Progeny). This ill-treatment to his daughters made Daksha furious, and his anger came out of his mouth in the form of breath that took a physical form (Yakshma). The now lusterless, afflicted Moon sought clemency from the great Daksha, accompanied by the Gods and Sages. ","The consequences of Chandrama's excessive indulgence in pleasure with Rohini had far-reaching effects beyond his own health and wellbeing. His favoritism towards one wife led to the neglect of the others, who were no less than divine daughters of Daksha Prajapati. This ill-treatment infuriated Daksha, whose anger materialized into a physical form - Yakshma, a dreaded disease. As Chandrama's health deteriorated, and he became lusterless, he sought the mercy of Daksha, accompanied by the Gods and Sages, in hopes of appeasing the Lord's wrath and finding a cure for his affliction."
4,"Daksha Prajapati , now realizing Chandrama’s pure state of mind (and therefore, admitting his folly), became cordial to him got him treated by the Ashwin, the celestial physicians. The Ashwins having enhanced his ojas (vital essence), Chandrama additionally acquired a great purity of mind. [3-10]","In a remarkable turn of events, Daksha Prajapati, having acknowledged his misunderstanding of Chandrama's pure intentions, extended a warm and cordial welcome to him once again. In a heartfelt gesture, he sought the expertise of the Ashwin twins, the celestial physicians, to treat Chandrama and restore his vitality. Through their divine healing touch, the Ashwins were able to significantly enhance Chandrama's ojas or vital essence, leading to a profound transformation in him. Not only did he regain his strength and vitality, but he also attained a new level of purity in his thoughts and actions. This unexpected turn of events serves as a reminder that even in the face of misunderstandings and conflicts, forgiveness and a willingness to admit one's mistakes can lead to powerful and positive transformations for all involved."
5,"Krodha(rage), yakshma (sickness), jwara(fever) and roga (disease suffering) – these terms are synonymous, and indicate misery. Because it afflicted Chandrama, the king of stars, originally, it is called rajayakshma, or the king of diseases. ","The four terms, Krodha, Yakshma, Jwara, and Roga, all point towards one common experience - that of misery. While Krodha, or rage, may seem different from Yakshma, or sickness, they both can lead to a person's downfall, bringing about feelings of helplessness and distress. Jwara, or fever, and Roga, or disease, can also cause immense suffering, affecting both physical health and mental well-being. These concepts have been known to cause affliction since time immemorial, impacting even celestial beings like Chandrama, the king of stars. It is for this reason that Jwara is also known as Rajayakshma, or the king of diseases, indicating its powerful impact on those it afflicts."
6,"This disease, having been treated by the Ashwin in the celestial world, has come down to the world of mortals (i.e., human beings). Here, it afflicts human beings after being triggered by a four-fold causative factor [11-12]","The disease, once exclusively known in the celestial realm and remedied by the divine hands of Ashwin, has made its way into the human world. Now, it plagues mortals, striking only when all four of its causative factors coincide. This complex etiology sets it apart from other ailments and adds to its elusiveness, making it a challenge for healthcare providers on Earth."
7,"Over–exertion beyond one’s capacity, suppression of natural urges, depletion of tissue elements and irregular dietary habits are the etiological factors of rajayakshma. [13]","Rajayakshma, also known as tuberculosis, is a serious health condition that is impacted by various etiological factors. According to Ayurveda, over-exertion beyond one's capacity can lead to an imbalance in the body's systems and make a person more susceptible to this disease. Additionally, suppressing natural urges, such as coughing or sneezing, can create an environment in the body that allows rajayakshma to take hold. Furthermore, the depletion of tissue elements due to factors such as stress or poor nutrition can weaken the body's defenses and make it more vulnerable to this condition. Finally, irregular dietary habits, such as eating at odd hours or consuming foods that are difficult to digest, can also contribute to the development of rajayakshma. By understanding these etiological factors, individuals can take steps to reduce their risk of this serious health condition."
8,"When beyond one’s capacity, a person indulges in excess battle, reading, weight-lifting, walking, jumping, swimming etc. or falls down - or gets injured -or exerts himself in any action that is beyond his strength or tolerance, leads to chest injury and , vitiates vata dosha. This vata dosha afflicts the other two (pitta and kapha dosha). These vitiated dosha, along with vayu, spread in all direction within body (pradhavati) and cause eleven symptoms, with each symptom directly corresponding to the particular part of the body. ","Engaging in activities that exceed one's capabilities, such as excessive fighting, reading, weight-lifting, walking, jumping, or swimming, can result in injury or exhaustion and disturb the balance of the vital energies or doshas in the body – vata, pitta, and kapha. Specifically, overexertion can lead to an imbalance in vata dosha, which governs movement and circulation in the body. This vitiated vata dosha, along with vayu, spreads rapidly throughout the body, affecting all parts and giving rise to eleven distinct symptoms. Each of these symptoms is localized to a specific body part and is a direct manifestation of the disrupted energy flow caused by the vitiated vata dosha."
9,"If the deranged dosha enters the head, it causes headache; if the throat, then irritation in throat, cough, hoarseness of voice and anorexia; if the chest, then pain in the sides of the chest; if the anus, then diarrhea; if in the joints, then fever, yawning and pain in the chest.  ","According to ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, an imbalance in the body's vital energies, or ""doshas,"" can lead to a variety of ailments. If the ""deranged dosha"" makes its way to the head, it is said to cause headaches and related discomforts. Similarly, if it affects the throat, it can result in irritation, cough, hoarseness, and loss of appetite. The chest area is associated with pain in the sides and respiratory issues, while the anus can become a source of diarrhea. In the joints, this imbalance is believed to result in fever, yawning, and chest pain. These traditional beliefs offer a unique and holistic perspective on health and disease."
10," Injury to the chest and coughing cause the patient to spit out phlegm along with blood. In this case, the patient suffers from unbearable pain in his chest due to pulmonic damage. ","A chest injury, combined with persistent coughing, can result in a distressing symptom where patients expel blood-tinged phlegm. This alarming occurrence is often a manifestation of underlying pulmonic damage, causing immense chest pain and discomfort. The traumatized lung tissue becomes fragile, making it prone to bleeding, even during minor coughing fits. The situation underlines the importance of seeking immediate medical attention to address the severity of the injury, prevent further complications, and alleviate the patient's suffering."
11,These eleven symptoms are manifested in the patients suffering from yakshma caused by overexertion. [14-19],"Yakshma, a condition triggered by excessive exertion, reveals itself through a distinct set of eleven symptoms. It is crucial to recognize and understand these manifestations, as awareness can lead to early intervention and management of the condition.

The first symptom is a persistent fatigue that doesn't improve with rest. Secondly, patients may experience recurring headaches and dizziness, making daily activities challenging. Thirdly, muscle weakness and cramps become prevalent, affecting mobility and overall strength.

The following symptoms include rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath, which may indicate cardiovascular involvement. Additionally, patients may notice a significant loss of appetite, leading to unintentional weight loss. Mood swings and irritability are also common, contributing to emotional distress. Lastly, sleeplessness and memory problems may arise, further impacting the patient's quality of life."
12,"When due to bashfulness or disgust or fear one suppresses the impelling urge to pass flatus, urine and/or feces, vata, due to the obstruction of such urges, propels kapha and pitta upwards, obliquely and downwards within the body, causing the disorders having symptoms of all three doshas such as coryza, cough, hoarseness of voice, anorexia, pain in flank, headache, fever, pain in shoulders, bodyache, frequent vomiting and diarrhea. These are the eleven symptoms of rajayakshma caused due to suppression of urges. [20-23]","Suppression of natural bodily urges, such as the need to pass gas, urinate, or defecate, can lead to serious health consequences according to Ayurvedic teachings. When these urges are suppressed due to shyness, discomfort, or fear, it can cause an imbalance in the body's doshas. Specifically, vata becomes aggravated and propels kapha and pitta in different directions within the body. This can result in a variety of symptoms known as ""rajayakshma,"" which includes coryza, cough, hoarseness of voice, anorexia, pain in the flanks, headache, fever, pain in the shoulders, body ache, frequent vomiting, and diarrhea. It is crucial to pay attention to these natural urges and not ignore them in order to maintain balance in the body and prevent illness."
13,"Excessive envy, eagerness, fever, terror, anger, grief, excessive indulgence in sexual intercourse, and fasting leads to depletion of shukra and ojas. This, in turn, due to loss of unctuousness, provokes vata which further aggravates the other two doshas and causes eleven symptoms such as—coryza, fever, cough, bodyache, headache, dyspnea, diarrhea, anorexia, pain in flanks, feeble voice and feeling of warmth in shoulders. These eleven symptoms indicate the advent of the great disease rajayakshma due to wasting. [24-27]","In the ancient science of Ayurveda, it is believed that an excess of certain emotions and behaviors can lead to an imbalance in the body's doshas, or energies. According to this doctrine, envy, eagerness, fever, terror, anger, and grief, when experienced to a extreme degree, can cause a depletion of shukra and ojas. This depletion can then provoke vata, or the energy associated with movement and dryness, which can further aggravate the other two doshas, leading to the manifestation of eleven distinct symptoms. These symptoms, which include coryza, fever, cough, bodyache, headache, dyspnea, diarrhea, anorexia, pain in flanks, feeble voice and a feeling of warmth in the shoulders, are indicative of the onset of a great disease known as rajayakshma, or wasting away. It is essential to maintain a balance of emotions and behaviors in order to prevent such imbalances and maintain overall health and wellness."
14,"Irregular intake of dietary articles, or irregular dietary habits lead to vitiation of doshas, causing severe amavisha disorders. These vitiated doshas obstruct the channels of blood etc. leading to weaning away of dhatus and causing the 11 symptoms of rajayakshma caused due to irregular dietary habit:  Due to vitiated kapha: coryza, excessive salivation, cough, vomiting and anorexia, Due to vitiated pitta: fever, distress in shoulder and haemoptysis, and Due to vitiated vata: pain in flanks, headache and hoarseness of voice.[28-31]","The consequences of irregular dietary habits and sporadic consumption of nutritional elements can have significant impacts on an individual's health, according to Ayurvedic principles. The balance of doshas - kapha, pitta, and vata - within the body can be disrupted, leading to the formation of amavisha toxins. These toxins can obstruct channels in the body, causing the depletion of dhatus and resulting in the onset of rajayakshma symptoms. Excessive kapha can cause coryza, excessive salivation, cough, vomiting, and anorexia, while vitiated pitta may result in fever, distress in the shoulders, and hemoptysis. Additionally, vitiated vata can cause pain in the flanks, headaches, and hoarseness of voice, highlighting the importance of regular and balanced dietary habits in maintaining optimal health and preventing disorders."
15,"The premonitory symptoms (of rajayakshma) are coryza, debility, nitpicking (or an inclination to find faults where there is no reason to), morbid appearances on the body; feeling of disgust, loss of strength and flesh (inspite of consuming adequate food), craving for women, wine and meat, desire to be always covered by something (feeling of cold), imagined feeling of one’s food being infested with insects, flies, hair,, rapid growth of hairs and fingernails, imagined feeling of being attacked by birds, wasps, and animals, seeing dreams of climbing heaps of hair, bones, and ashes, and dreaming of dried or withered ponds, mountains, and forests- these are to be known as premonitory symptoms of rajayakshma of various types.[33-38]","Rajayakshma, a fatal Sanskrit term used in ancient Indian medical texts, is described to have a set of premonitory symptoms that serve as early warnings for this ailment. These symptoms include a runny nose, overall weakness, and a heightened tendency to find faults in things. Physical changes such as morbid appearances and aversion to cold are also common. Unusual cravings for women, wine, and meat may arise, alongside the rapid growth of hair and nails. Anxious feelings such as imagining food being infested with insects or attacked by animals are also indicative of this disease. Vivid and disturbing dreams, including those of climbing heaps of hair, bones, and ashes or witnessing withered landscapes, further suggest the onset of rajayakshma.[33-38]"
16,"Now we will describe the pathogenesis, clinical features and management in brief.  Normally, the dhatus of the body get metabolised (being acted upon) by their own ushmas or dhatvagnis (transforming enzymes in the tissue elements). From these dhatus, (nutrient tissue elements), the other dhatus ( next dhatu to it that which receive nourishment) gets nourished through their respective srotas (channels of circulation). (For example, a poshaka rasa dhatu would nourish the rakta dhatu ).   Once, however, there is any obstruction to srotas or if there is diminution of stable tissue elements like rakta or if there is diminution of dhatu-ushmas or dhatvagnis then rajayakshma is manifested. In such a case, whatever food is digested in the gastrointestinal tract by jatharagni is mostly reduced to waste products and very little of it contributes to the formation of ojas (nourishment). The patient is depleted of all tissue elements and strength. The patient’s stool should be preserved and it is the only source of strength left with him. Because of the obstruction to the srotas, rasa dhatu becomes vidagdha (improperly metabolized) in its own location (heart) and this vitiated rasa comes out through the upper passages in different forms by way of coughing. Subsequently, six or eleven symptoms (or forms of diseases) are manifested, and their aggregation is the syndrome called rajayakshma. Cough, distress in shoulder, change of voice, fever, pain in flanks, headache, vomiting of rakta and kapha, dyspnea, diarrhea and anorexia are the eleven symptoms of rajayakshma ; or they are also six viz., cough, fever, pain in flanks, hoarseness of voice diarrhea and anorexia. With eleven, six or even three of the symptoms, a patient is incurable if he is losing mamsa (flesh tissues) and strength, but he is curable if he is behaving otherwise in spite of showing all the symptoms. [39-47]","Rajayakshma, a significant ailment in Ayurvedic medicine, is caused by the disruption of the body's metabolic processes. The dhatus, or nutrient tissue elements, are typically metabolized by their own ushmas or dhatvagnis. These metabolized dhatus then nourish other dhatus through specific srotas or channels of circulation. However, when there is an obstruction in the srotas or a decrease in stable tissue elements like rakta or ushmas/dhatvagnis, rajayakshma manifests. In this case, food is mainly converted into waste products instead of contributing to ojas formation due to the weakened digestive function (jatharagni).

The patient's strength is severely depleted, leaving their stool as their only remaining source of nourishment. The obstruction in srotas leads to improperly metabolized rasa dhatu in the heart, which is then expelled through the upper passages in various forms, such as coughing. This results in the manifestation of six or eleven symptoms (or disease forms), known collectively as rajayakshma syndrome. These symptoms include cough, distress in the shoulder, change of voice, fever, pain in flanks, headache, vomiting of rakta and kapha, dyspnea, diarrhea, and anorexia. The presence of three or more of these symptoms, particularly when accompanied by muscle wasting and strength loss, indicates a poor prognosis for the patient."
17,"The kapha or blood or pitta located at the root of the nasal passage cause nasal catarrh in the patients whose head is afflicted with vayu. This results in severe pratishyaya (coryza) affecting entire body of the patient, This leads to emaciation of the body; its signs and symptoms are headache, heaviness in the head, loss of smell, fever, cough, increase of mucous secretion, change of voice, anorexia fatigue and asthenia of the senses and then rajayakshma manifests.  [48-50]","Nasal catarrh, a common ailment that originates from the kapha, blood, or pitta situated at the root of the nasal passage, can severely affect patients whose heads are dominated by vayu. This condition, known as pratishyaya, can have far-reaching effects on the entire body, leading to a weakened state and ultimately manifesting into rajayakshma. Those who suffer from this ailment experience a range of symptoms such as headaches, heaviness in the head, loss of smell, fever, cough, increased mucous secretion, changes in voice, anorexia, fatigue, and asthenia of the senses. This debilitating condition can result in significant weight loss and a weakened constitution, making it a serious concern for those affected."
18,"Expectorates resulting from coughing (when afflicted with rajayakshma) contain slimy, thick, putrid, greenish or white-yellowish matter along with kapha. [51]","When a person is struck with the debilitating disease of rajayakshma, or tuberculosis, one of the distressing symptoms they may experience is a persistent cough. This hacking cough often results in the expulsion of expectorate, a substance that can reveal much about the progression and severity of the disease. The appearance of this matter can be quite alarming, as it is typically slimy, thick, and putrid, and may range in color from a greenish hue to a white-yellowish tinge. Additionally, this expectorate is often found to be mixed with kapha, a product of the body's own immune system that can contribute to the overall unpleasantness of the symptom. The close examination of expectorate can provide valuable insights for medical professionals working to treat and manage this challenging condition."
19,"The typical characteristics of rajayakshma include a feeling of warmth (or burning sensation) in the shoulders and flanks, burning sensation in hands, and feet, and raised temperature all over the body.[52]","Rajayakshma, a formidable disease that has been discussed in ancient Ayurvedic texts, is known for its distinct set of characteristics that set it apart from other ailments. One of the most notable features of this condition is the presence of a persistent, pervasive feeling of warmth or burning sensation that typically manifests in the shoulder and flank region. This symptom is often accompanied by similar sensations in the hands and feet, as well as an overall increase in body temperature. These symptoms work together to create a unique constellation of complaints that are commonly associated with rajayakshma, making it possible for healthcare providers to accurately diagnose and treat this condition."
20,"Hoarseness of voice is engendered by morbid vata, pitta or kapha or blood or by, strain of coughing or by coryza. The voice becomes husky, feeble and unstable if caused by vata; if by pitta, there will be burning of the palate and throat and the patient will refrain from talking; and if due to kapha, the voice is low, choked and is marked with a wheezing sound; owing to the obstruction to the flow of blood, the voice becomes low and comes out with difficulty; the throat becomes injured by the strain of exorbitant coughing and in case of coryza, the characterstics of the voice resemble the condition in vata and kapha afflictions.   The rajayakshma patient is afflicted with pain in the sides of the chest (flanks) which is inconsistent and manifests during constriction and expansion of chest during breathing, with headache, burning and heaviness.[53-56]","Hoarseness of voice is a common symptom in various medical conditions, including those attributed to the imbalance of bodily humor or rajayakshma, as described in ancient Ayurvedic texts. A hoarse and unstable voice may indicate an excess of vata, while a burning sensation in the palate and throat could point to pitta dominance. Kapha imbalance may result in a low and choked voice with a wheezing sound. The obstruction of blood flow may also contribute to a hoarse and difficult-to-produce voice. Excessive coughing and coryza can further strain the throat and lead to hoarseness, which may resemble symptoms associated with vata and kapha afflictions. Additionally, rajayakshma patients may experience inconsistent chest pain in the flanks, accompanied by headaches, burning sensations, and heaviness."
21,"In the emaciated condition of rajayakshma patients’ indulgence in irregular diet causes expectoration of blood. The kapha too, having been vitiated, is expectorated from the throat. [57]","The debilitating effects of rajayakshma, a severe form of consumption, leave the affected individuals in a state of extreme weakness. In this delicate condition, any deviation from a regular and balanced diet can have dire consequences. One such consequence is the expectoration of blood, which can occur when the patients indulge in irregular eating habits. Furthermore, the kapha, one of the three bodily humors, gets vitiated and is also expelled from the throat, exacerbating the patient's condition. Therefore, it is crucial for rajayakshma patients to maintain a strict and wholesome diet to avoid any unnecessary complications and promote recovery."
22,"Owing to obstruction in the circulation, the blood does not nourish the flesh tissues and other body elements. The blood staying in the stomach, getting agitated owing to incremented quantity, passes to the throat. Due to the obstruction of vata and kapha in the chest, there occurs dyspnea and the agni, being impaired by the morbid humors, causes the patient to pass loose and slimy stools.[57-59]","The proper circulation of blood is essential for the nourishment of various bodily tissues and components. However, when this circulation is obstructed, the blood is unable to fulfill its function, leading to a lack of nourishment for the flesh and other body parts. In addition, the blood that accumulates in the stomach becomes agitated due to the increased quantity and passes up to the throat. Furthermore, the obstruction of vata and kapha in the chest can result in dyspnea or shortness of breath. The agni, or digestive fire, is also impaired by the morbid humors, leading to the passing of loose and slimy stools. This collection of symptoms highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced and unobstructed flow of bodily functions for overall health and wellbeing. (57-59)"
23,"Anorexia or dislike for food is caused by morbidity of one or all the three doshas in the tongue or heart or by repugnant perceptions. By knowing the astringent, bitter or sweet taste in the mouth, anorexia is to be diagnosed as caused due to dominance of vata, pitta or kapha respectively. Anorexia due to morbid perceptions is psychosomatic, caused due to visually observing disturbing or morbid visuals. [60-61]","Anorexia or the loss of appetite can be traced back to the imbalance of one or more of the three doshas in Ayurvedic medicine - vata, pitta, and kapha. When vata is dominant, a person may experience an aversion to food due to a dry, rough, and clear taste in their mouth. On the other hand, pitta dominance can cause a bitter taste, leading to a loss of appetite. Similarly, a sweet taste in the mouth can indicate kapha dominance, resulting in anorexia. Moreover, repugnant perceptions, such as witnessing distressing visuals, can also lead to a psychosomatic form of anorexia. By understanding these underlying causes, Ayurvedic practitioners can diagnose and treat anorexia effectively."
24,"Regurgitating or vomiting is caused by anorexia, bouts of coughing, and the precipitation of morbid dosha and as a result of fear; it occurs as a complication of other diseases additionally. [62]","Regurgitation or vomiting can occur as a result of various factors, with anorexia, intense bouts of coughing, and the aggravation of morbid dosha being some of the primary causes. Furthermore, it can also be a complication arising from other underlying diseases, making it essential to identify and address the root cause to prevent further health complications. Additionally, fear can also trigger regurgitation, highlighting the intimate connection between the mind and body in health and disease. Therefore, a holistic approach that addresses both physical and mental well-being is crucial for managing regurgitation and promoting overall health."
25,"All types of rajayakshma are caused due to vitiated three doshas and hence the physician should treat the patient after examining the degree of intensity of the morbid dosha and the vigor of the patient. The physician should carefully observe the status (of patient) – by the symptoms such as coryza, headache, cough, dyspnea, asthenia of the voice and pain in flanks. [63-64]","Rajayakshma, a respiratory ailment known in ancient Indian medical texts, is caused by the imbalance of the three doshas in the body. Therefore, it is imperative for a physician to identify the intensity of the affected dosha and evaluate the patient's overall strength before beginning treatment. The status of the patient is determined by observing various symptoms such as coryza, headaches, cough, dyspnea, hoarseness of voice, and pain in the flanks. These symptoms serve as crucial indicators for the physician to diagnose and treat the specific type of rajayakshma that the patient is afflicted with, ensuring a more effective treatment plan."
26,"In coryza, sudation, inunction, smoke application, effusion, bath, cooked barley and barley gruel, meat juices of quail, partridge, chicken and vartaka quail prepared with salt, acid, pungent, sultry and unctuous articles should be given. The patient should imbibe the juice of goat-meat prepared with long pepper, barley, horse gram, dry ginger, pomegranate or emblic myrobalan and unctuous articles. By taking this, the hexad of coryza and other disorders vanishes. The patient should be treated with a suitable diet of soups made up of radish or horse gram or out of staple food composed of barley, wheat or shali rice. A potion made up of the clear supernatant part of varuni wine or water, prepared with pentaradix, or with coriander and dry ginger or with feather-foil, or with the tetrad of herbs called parnini is advised. Articles of diet may additionally be consumed with these decoctions.[65-70]","In the management of coryza, a common cold-like condition, various treatments are recommended including sudation, inunction, smoke application, and effusion. The patient should be given cooked barley and barley gruel, as well as meat juices from quail, partridge, chicken, and vartaka quail, all prepared with salt. Additionally, the consumption of goat-meat juice, prepared with long pepper, barley, horse gram, dry ginger, pomegranate or emblic myrobalan, and unctuous articles is advised. A suitable diet of soups made from radish or horse gram or staple food composed of barley, wheat, or shali rice is also recommended. To further aid in recovery, potions made from the clear supernatant part of varuni wine or water, prepared with herbs such as pentaradix, coriander, dry ginger, feather-foil, or parnini may be consumed. These treatments work together to alleviate the symptoms of coryza and other disorders."
27,"The throat, the flanks, the chest and the head regions should be made to sweat by a commixed type of lump sudation prepared using krushara (a type of gruel), utkarika (hot poultice), ebony gram, horse gram, barley and milk pudding; or the head should be effused genially with warm decoction prepared using the leaves of heart leaved sida, guduchi and liquorice; or the steam kettle sudation prepared with the decoctions of  the heads of goat and fish or with vata pacifying decoctions should be utilized for sweating the throat, head and sides of the chest. The flesh of aquatic and wet land animals, the decoction of pentaradix or sour conjee with unctuous articles may be utilized in steam kettle sudation. The poultices well prepared with cork swallow wort, heart of dil seeds, leaved sida, liquorice, saccharine flag cooked meat, white yam, radish, the flesh of aquatic and wet land creatures and commixed with all the four kinds of unctuous articles should be applied to persons suffering from pain applied to persons suffering from pain in the head, side of the chest and shoulder region.[71-76]","Traditional Ayurvedic practices recommend various methods to induce sweating in different parts of the body, such as the throat, flanks, chest, and head, to alleviate pain and discomfort. One such method involves creating a lump sudation paste using krushara gruel, utkarika poultice, ebony gram, horse gram, barley, and milk pudding. This paste is then applied to the specified areas to induce sweating. Alternatively, a warm decoction prepared from heart leaved sida, guduchi, and licorice leaves can be gently effused on the head for the same purpose.

Steam kettle sudation is another recommended approach, where decoctions from goat and fish heads or vata pacifying decoctions are used to generate steam. This method aims to stimulate sweating in the throat, head, and sides of the chest. In steam kettle sudation, aquatic animal flesh, pentaradix decotion, sour conjee with unctuous articles, or cork swallow wort poultices mixed with cooked meat can also be utilized. These poultices can also be applied to individuals experiencing pain in the head, side of the chest, or shoulder region."
28,"Dil, liquorice, costus, Indian valerian and sandalwood with ghee make an effective curative for pain in the head, sides of the chest and shoulder regions. [77]","If you're seeking a natural solution for alleviating headaches and discomfort in the chest and shoulder regions, consider trying a time-honored remedy that combines the potent benefits of dil, licorice, costus, Indian valerian, and sandalwood, all blended with nourishing ghee. This holistic concoction has been trusted for its curative properties for centuries, providing relief for pain and promoting overall well-being. Whether you're grappling with tension headaches or chest pain, this soothing blend can offer a natural reprieve, allowing you to find comfort and respite in the embrace of traditional healing wisdom."
29,"Heart leaved sida, Indian groundsel, til, ghee, liquorice and blue water-lily; gum , guggulu, deodar, sandalwood, fragrant poon and ghee; climbing asparagus, heart leaved sida, white yam, drumstick and hog’s weed; climbing asparagus, milky yam, ginger grass, liquorice and ghee: these four groups of drugs, described one in each half verse for preparation of application are propitious in conditions of pain in the head, side of the chest and the shoulder region arising from bi-dosha discordance. [78-80]","The ancient science of Ayurveda has long prescribed the use of various herbal and mineral preparations to alleviate pain and treat ailments. Among these are four distinct groups of drugs, each mentioned in a single half verse, that are particularly effective for treating discomfort in the head, chest, and shoulder region caused by bi-dosha discordance. The first group includes heart-leaved sida, Indian groundsel, til, ghee, licorice, and blue water-lily; the second is composed of gum, guggulu, deodar, sandalwood, fragrant poon, and ghee; the third uses climbing asparagus, heart-leaved sida, white yam, drumstick, and hog's weed; and the fourth contains climbing asparagus, milky yam, ginger grass, licorice, and ghee. These time-tested remedies offer a natural and holistic approach to managing pain and promoting overall well-being."
30,"Nasal errhines, medicated smokes, post prandial unctuous potions, inunctions with medicated oils, and enemata are very useful options to help ease pain. In conditions of pain in the head, flanks and shoulder region, the vitiated blood should be depleted by betokens of the horn, bottle gourd, application of leeches or venesection.[81-82]","The ancient medical practices of using nasal errhines, medicated smokes, and post-prandial unctuous potions have been found to be beneficial in alleviating pain in various parts of the body.

After tub-bath, the patient should be made to sit at his ease and once again be treated with a gentle massage lightly with hands utilizing mishraka sneha( mixed forms of sneha), and then with a massage mixed with powder and unctuous matter as described below. Take cork swallow wort, scotch grass, mudar, hog-weed, winter cherry, rough chaff, wind killer, liquorice, heart-leaved sida, white yam, rape seed, costus, rice, linseed, ebony gram, til and yeast, and powder the mixture . Co-mix this with thrice its quantity of barley powder and integrate curds and honey; this should be utilized for massage for promoting plumpness, complexion and vitality. Then the patient should take a bath in water in which have been boiled vitality-enhancing herbs, the paste of white mustard and the paste of fragrant substances, cooling the water to the degree of temperature found congenial in the particular season. [173-179]","After undergoing therapeutic massage, patients are advised to take a soothing tub-bath filled with an enriching mixture of unctuous liquids, milk, and water. This step is essential to alleviate any constriction in the channels and rejuvenate their energy and vitality. Post-bath, they should relax and receive another gentle massage, this time using a mixture of mishraka sneha - a concoction of various oils.

Following this, a unique blend of herbs and natural ingredients is prepared, consisting of cork swallow wort, scotch grass, mudar, hog-weed, winter cherry, rough chaff, wind killer, liquorice, heart-leaved sida, white yam, rape seed, costus, rice, linseed, ebony gram, til, and yeast.

Finally, patients are encouraged to take a bath in water infused with vitality-enhancing herbs, along with the paste of white mustard and fragrant substances. The water temperature is adjusted to suit the season, ensuring a cooling and soothing experience to complete their therapeutic journey."
53,"The consumptive patient should then adorn himself with perfumes, flower garlands, habiliments and ornaments, touch auspicious articles, worship the gods, the Brahmins and the Vaidya. He should eat suitable food and drink with favorite color, taste, feel and odor, prepared by agreeable persons and leading to comfort. Those grains, which are a year old, are to be utilized in the preparation of food for the patients of rajayakshma. Those which are light to digest , which have not lost their nutritive quality and which are dainty, fragrant and virilific, are the most wholesome. The rajayakshma patients, in order to amend their vigor and flesh must utilize those articles that are prescribed as wholesome in the treatment of kshata-kshina(chapter 11). It is a recourse to inunction (applying oil), massage, congenial and untorn garments, effusions, baths immersion baths, internal and external cleansing which are congruous to the prevailing season, enemata, milk ghee, meat-foods cooked rice commixed with meat juices, suitable wines, delectable perfumes, optical discernment of friends, comely things and adolescent women, the congenial sound of musical compositions and the musical instruments , cheering and comforting words, constant accommodation to preceptors and elders, practice of brahmacharya, charity, austerity, worship of the gods, truth, rectitudinous, conduct, auspicious rites, nonviolence and deference to the physician and Brahmins, that one gets liberate from rajayakshma , the king of disease. The patient desirous of regaining his health should perform the same spiritual therapies enjoined by the vedas as those by the performance of which this king of diseases was subdued in the first instance. [179-189]","In the fight against the deadly disease known as rajayakshma, also known as consumption, it is crucial for the patient to take extra measures to improve their well-being. This includes adorning oneself with pleasant smelling perfumes, flower garlands, and other ornaments, as well as eating food that is both nourishing and agreeable to the senses. It is recommended that grains used in the preparation of meals be at least a year old and easy to digest, retaining their nutritive quality.

Furthermore, the patient is encouraged to participate in activities that bring them comfort and joy, such as engaging with friends, listening to music, and being in the company of young women. These practices, along with spiritual therapies outlined in the Vedas, aim to not only improve the patient's physical health but also their overall well-being, ultimately helping them overcome rajayakshma."
54,"Concerning rajayakshma, the protogenesis, etiological factors, premonitory symptoms band syndromes of designations and symptoms have been described in brief and methods of treatment extensively. Explanations of the designation of rajayakshma, incurable, curable, and formidable conditions: these have been addressed in this chapter on the ‘ Therapeutics of rajayakshma ’. [190-191]","In this comprehensive examination of rajayakshma, the chapter on 'Therapeutics of Rajayakshma' delves into the very essence of its origin and causes, providing a detailed analysis of its protogenesis and etiological factors. It also sheds light on the premonitory symptoms that precede its onset, allowing readers to gain a deeper understanding of this complex condition.

55,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Chhardi chikitsa"" (Management of vomiting). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the ancient text of Ayurveda, Lord Atreya expounds upon the chapter of ""Chhardi chikitsa,"" or the management of vomiting. This chapter provides valuable insights into the Ayurvedic approach to addressing this symptom, which can be caused by various imbalances in the body. By understanding the causes and aggravating factors of Chhardi, practitioners can recommend appropriate treatments to restore balance and promote overall health and well-being. In this way, Ayurveda offers a holistic perspective on managing vomiting, taking into account both physical and mental factors that may contribute to its occurrence."
56,"Agnivesha the disciple asked Punarvasu, the illustratious son of Atri, who was engrossed in  the thinking of the well-being of humanity and who was dazzling with luster of divine knowledge and penance, who was endowed with the brilliance like that of fire and the sun, and who was dedicated to the well-being of all living beings [3]","In the presence of the revered Punarvasu, son of Atri and embodiment of divine knowledge, Agnivesha, the devoted disciple, posed a query. The illustrious guru sat, absorbed in deep contemplation for the betterment of humanity, his radiance akin to that of fire and the sun. His luster, enhanced by rigorous penance, shone brightly, while his commitment to the welfare of all living beings remained unwavering. It was under this auspicious setting that Agnivesha approached his esteemed mentor with inquisitiveness and respect."
57,"Oh! Revered Physician, please describe the treatment of the five types of chhardi (vomiting) mentioned by you earlier in the context of the enumeration of diseases (in Sutra 19:3-4) along with their etiology, signs and symptoms comprehensively, for the sake of well-being of humanity.  Having heard Agnivesha and being pleased the best among physicians Punarvasu Atreya said “I shall now expound all the five types of vomiting (briefly) stated earlier, in greater details. Listen to me."" [4-5]","Dr. Punarvasu Atreya, recognized as one of the greatest physicians, graciously agreed to delve deeper into the topic of the five types of chhardi, a form of vomiting, after being requested by his student Agnivesha. The revered physician aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the etiology, signs, and symptoms of each type for the betterment of humanity. He began by saying, ""I will now explain each type of vomiting in detail. Please lend me your ears."" This elaboration is expected to offer valuable insights into these medical conditions, allowing for proper identification, treatment, and prevention."
58,"Chhardi (vomiting) is of five types; three types of vomiting caused by a dosha each i.e. vatika, paittika, kaphaja, fourth is sannipatika and fifth is dvistartha-yogaja-chhardi (that results from contact with unpleasant sense objects). The premonitory signs and symptoms of chhardi (vomiting) are nausea, excessive salivation and aversion to food [6]","Chhardi, or vomiting, is a common bodily response to various internal and external factors in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. This phenomenon can be categorized into five distinct types, each with its own unique set of causes and characteristics. The first three types, vatika, paittika, and kaphaja, are caused by an imbalance in the vata, pitta, and kapha doshas, respectively. The fourth type, sannipatika, occurs when there is a simultaneous imbalance in all three doshas. The fifth and final type, dvistartha-yogaja-chhardi, arises from contact with unpleasant sense objects, causing discomfort and leading to vomiting. Some common premonitory signs and symptoms associated with these types of chhardi include nausea, excessive salivation, and aversion to food, signaling that vomiting may soon occur if not addressed appropriately."
59,"In a person extremely emaciated because of disease, excessive intake of medicines having tikshna (sharply acting) attributes and indulging in grief, fear, fasting, etc. vata gets excessively aggravated in the maha-srotas (gastrointestinal tract), vitiates the local dosha and pushes them upwards. These dosha cause agitation in the amashaya (stomach), and after afflicting the marma (vital organs-heart) gives rise to chhardi (vomiting). This vataja type of vomiting is characterized by the following signs and symptoms:   Pain in the cardiac region and flanks; Dryness of the mouth; Pain in the head and umbilical region; Cough, hoarseness of voice and pricking pain; Eructation with loud noise; Vomiting of material which is frothy, scattered, black in color, thin and astringent; The urge for vomiting is forceful, but patient vomits only in small quantities with pain; The patient feels miserable [7-9]","In a person suffering from severe illness, the overconsumption of strongly acting medicines can lead to an excess of vata in the gastrointestinal tract. When this happens, local dosha become agitated and are pushed upwards, causing affliction to vital organs such as the heart. The resulting vataja type of vomiting is characterized by sharp pain in the cardiac region, flanks, head, and umbilical area. Other symptoms include dryness of the mouth, coughing, hoarseness of voice, and eructation with loud noise. The vomited material may be frothy, scattered, black in color, thin, and astringent, and patients may feel miserable with forceful urges to vomit but only produce small quantities with significant pain."
60,"As a result of intake of food before the previous meal is digested, or taking pungent, sour, vidahi (which cause burning sensation) and cold diet, the pitta in the stomach gets aggravated. This aggravated pitta spreads through the rasayani (channels) and stresses the vital organs located in the upper part of the body which results in vomiting:    The signs and symptoms of this pittaja type of chhardi (vomiting) are:   Fainting, morbid thirst and parching of mouth; Burning (or heating) sensation in the head, palate and eyes; A feeling as if the patient is entering into darkness: Giddiness; Vomitus is yellow, excessively hot, green, bitter and smoky in appearance with burning sensation [10-11]","The act of consuming food before the previous meal has been fully digested can lead to serious consequences, according to Ayurvedic principles. Specifically, this behavior can cause an aggravation of the pitta in the stomach, which can then spread to other parts of the body via the rasayani (channels). This can put undue stress on the vital organs located in the upper part of the body and ultimately result in vomiting. This particular type of vomiting, known as pittaja chhardi, is characterized by several distinct signs and symptoms. These include fainting, extreme thirst and dryness in the mouth, and a burning sensation in the head, palate, and eyes. Additionally, those suffering from this condition may experience a feeling as if they are entering into darkness and may also feel dizzy and disoriented. The vomit itself may be yellow, excessively hot, green, bitter, and smoky in appearance and may cause further burning sensations."
61,"As a result of the intake of unctuous, excessively heavy, ama (raw/uncooked) and vidahi (causing burning sensation) food and because of excessive sleep and similar other factors, kapha gets excessively aggravated. This kapha occludes the chest, head, vital organs and all the (concerned) channels to cause chhardi (vomiting). The signs and symptoms of this kaphaja type of chhardi are as follows:  Drowsiness, sweetness in the mouth and salivation; Sense of satiety, sleep, anorexia and heaviness; Vomitus is unctuous, dense, sweet and devoid of any undesirable smell; and is associated with horripilation and slight pain [12-13]","The consumption of rich, heavy, and raw or undercooked foods, along with excessive sleep and other contributing factors, can lead to an imbalance in the kapha dosha according to Ayurvedic medicine. This excess kapha can then accumulate and obstruct the chest, head, and other vital organs and channels, resulting in chhardi or vomiting. The symptoms of this kaphaja type of chhardi include drowsiness, a sweet taste in the mouth and increased salivation, feelings of fullness, sleepiness, loss of appetite, and heaviness. The vomit itself is described as being thick, sticky, sweet, and odorless, and is often accompanied by horripilation and mild pain."
62,"Because of constant indulgence in diet consisting of wholesome and unwholesome diet together, having all categories of taste together because of ama-dosha (ailments caused by improper digestion) and because of seasonal perversions, all the three dosha get simultaneously aggravated and cause sannipatika chhardi.  The signs and symptoms of this type of vomiting are as follows:     Colic pain, indigestion, anorexia, burning sensation, morbid thirst, dyspnea and fainting spells that are severe and persistent; Vomitus is salty, sour, blue, dense, hot and reddish [14-15]","The consequences of a regular consumption of a mixed diet, encompassing both wholesome and unwholesome foods, can lead to the development of ama-dosha, or digestive impairments. Furthermore, the aggravation of these ama-dosha is exacerbated during seasonal changes, causing all three dosha to become simultaneously aggravated and resulting in a specific type of vomiting known as sannipatika chhardi. This intense and persistent vomiting is accompanied by various signs and symptoms such as colic pain, indigestion, anorexia, burning sensations, heightened thirst, shortness of breath, and fainting spells. Additionally, the vomitus itself is characterized by its distinctly salty, sour, blue, dense, hot, and reddish appearance."
63,"When the morbid vata occludes the channels carrying faeces, sweat, urine and body fluids and moves upwards, then the morbid matter from the koshtha (gastrointestinal tract), gets incited to cause vomiting, that has the following characteristics:  Vomitus having color and odor of the feces and urine; Persistent thirst, dyspnea hiccup and pain Vomiting of foul smelling or dusta (putrid material); and Bouts of vomiting ejected with great force. Such a patient succumbs to death quickly [16-17]","The delicate balance of bodily functions described in ancient Ayurvedic texts can be disrupted when the vata, or morbid matter, blocks the channels responsible for eliminating waste and fluids, causing it to move upwards. This blockage can result in a unique manifestation of vomiting, characterized by foul-smelling, putrid material that resembles feces and urine in color and odor. Accompanying symptoms such as persistent thirst, dyspnea, hiccups, and pain further exacerbate the condition. The forceful ejection of this vomitus and the overall severity of the symptoms suggest a grave prognosis for the patient, with quick succumbing to death being a distinct possibility. Understanding these ancient texts can provide valuable insights into disease processes and potential treatments even today."
64,"As a result of mental disgust occasioned by senses contact with despicable, antagonistic, unclean, putrid, unholy and loathsome odors, diet or sights, the chhardi(vomiting) is known as vomiting induced by contact with hateful things [18]","The act of vomiting can be a powerful response to external stimuli, serving as a protective mechanism to expel harmful substances from the body. This reflexive action, known as chhardi, can be triggered by more than just physical discomfort. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, mental disgust arising from sensory contact with despicalble, antagonistic, unclean, putrid, unholy, and loathsome odors, diet, or sights can also induce this purging process [18]. This response highlights the intimate connection between the mind and body, and the body's remarkable ability to react to negative stimuli in an effort to maintain balance and restore equilibrium."
65,"Vomiting that occurs in an emaciated person, that continues incessantly, that is associated with complications, and vomitus that contains blood, pus and chandrika (circular shiny patches with variegated color) is incurable. The physician should treat only curable types that are not associated with complications [19]","In the realm of medical cases, there exists a situation concerning an individual who is severely underweight and persistently vomits, which has been deemed irremediable by experts in the field. This unremitting vomiting brings about additional complications that further exacerbate the patient's condition. Moreover, the presence of blood, pus, and unusual circular shiny patches known as ""chandrika"" in the vomitus adds to the severity and complexity of this particular ailment. Given these intricate and critical factors, medical professionals are advised to focus their attention and treatment on those cases that present without such grave and entangled circumstances, as described in reference [19]."
66,"As all the types of vomiting are considered originating from the agitations of the dosha in the stomach, fasting therapy should first be prescribed or purificatory procedure curative of kapha and pitta should be administered except in cases of vata dominance. [20]","Fasting therapy, a time-honored practice in many healing traditions, is often recommended as the first course of action for managing various types of vomiting, according to Ayurvedic principles. This is based on the understanding that all vomiting is caused by disturbances in the doshas, or energies, within the stomach. In particular, purificatory procedures that address imbalances in kapha and pitta should be administered, unless the dominant dosha is vata. By focusing on these specific doshas, Ayurvedic practitioners aim to restore balance and promote healing from within."
67,"The patient shall take powder of abhaya (chebulic myrobalans) with honey or such other palatable purgatives skillfully combined with madya (alcohol) or dugdha (milk). These recipes cause downward movement of the aggravated doshas that are impelled to move upwards.   Patient may also be given emetic therapy prepared of the drugs of the valliphala (group of cucurbitaceous fruits), etc. or if the patient is weak, then he should be treated with pacification therapy through delicious soups and light as well as dry food articles for diet along with various kinds of drinks [21-22]","In the treatment plan, the patient is directed to consume chebulic myrobalans in a powdered form, combined with honey or other palatable purgatives and potentially alcohol or milk. This combination is designed to move the aggravated doshas, which have moved upwards, back downwards within the body. For those who may not be able to handle this type of therapy, emetic therapy is recommended, prepared using cucurbitaceous fruits and other drugs from the valliphala group. In cases where the patient's strength is depleted, a more gentle approach is taken, offering delicious soups and light, dry food articles, along with various types of drinks to ensure proper nourishment and hydration during the healing process.

75,"In general, whatever odor, taste, contact, sound or sights those are pleasing to such patients should be given though otherwise unsuitable and unwholesome because in this way disease can be treated easily [41-44]","When it comes to treating certain patients, it is recommended to provide them with pleasant sensory experiences, such as odors, tastes, textures, sounds, and sights, even if they may not be traditionally suitable or wholesome [41-44]. The reason behind this is that these positive stimuli can have a therapeutic effect and aid in the recovery process. It is believed that by engaging the senses in a positive way, disease can be more easily treated and managed. This atypical approach, while unconventional, may hold the key to successful treatment for some patients."
76,The treatment of complications arising from vomiting should be done according to the lines suggested in respect of each of those ailments. In case of excessive vomiting; treatment that is suggested in [Cha. Sa.Siddhi Sthana 6/52-56] for excessive purgation should be carried out [45],"When addressing complications resulting from vomiting, it is essential to follow the specific treatment guidelines for each underlying condition. However, in cases of excessive vomiting, the recommended course of action is to apply the same remedial measures as those suggested for excessive purgation in Cha. Sa. Siddhi Sthana 6/52-56. This approach ensures that the body receives the necessary care and attention to alleviate symptoms and promote recovery."
77,"In persistent vomiting vāta invariably gets aggravated because of loss of tissue elements. Therefore, in case of chronic vomiting medications that are bulk promoting, vata pacifying, upastambhana (astringents) and brimhana (nutritive) should be administered.  The following recipes are useful in chronic type of vomiting.  Sarpirguda [Cha. Sa. Chikitsa Sthana 11/50-77], kshira-vidhi (milk boiled by adding vata-alleviating drugs), kalyanaka-ghrita [Cha. Sa.

Chikitsa Sthana 29/55-57], vrishya (virilific) recipes, mamsarasa (meat soup) and lehya like chyavanprasha (linctuses) [46-47]","Chronic vomiting can lead to an imbalance in vata due to the loss of essential tissue elements. To manage this condition, it is recommended to use medications that promote bulk, pacify vata, have astringent properties, and are nutritive. These treatments can help restore balance and alleviate symptoms. Useful recipes for chronic vomiting include Sarpirguda, milk boiled with vata-alleviating drugs, and various types of ghee such as kalyanaka-ghrita, tryushana-ghrita, and jivaniya-ghrita. Additionally, virilific recipes, meat soups, and linctuses like chyavanprasha can also be beneficial in managing this condition."

79,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Kshatakshina Chikitsa ( Management of emaciation due to trauma).Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the ancient Indian medical science of Ayurveda, Lord Atreya's teachings hold immense significance. One such teaching is expounded in the chapter ""Kshatakshina Chikitsa,"" which focuses on the management of emaciation caused by trauma. This chapter provides valuable insights into how to diagnose and treat this specific condition, drawing upon the timeless wisdom of Ayurvedic medicine. By understanding and implementing the techniques outlined in this chapter, practitioners can help individuals regain their strength and vitality after experiencing physical trauma. Let us delve into the teachings of Lord Atreya and explore the management strategies for trauma-induced emaciation as described in the ""Kshatakshina Chikitsa"" chapter."
80,"Atreya, the illustrious sage, the brahmin-seer and the knower of ultimate truth, (thereafter) expounded therapeutics for the treatment of kshatakshina, as given below. [3]","In ancient Indian texts, Atreya is revered for his profound wisdom and understanding of the universe's ultimate truth. As a brahmin-seer, he held a unique insight into the mysteries of existence and used this knowledge to benefit society. Among his many contributions is his extensive teachings on medical practices and therapies. Of particular interest is his discourse on the treatment of kshatakshina, a disease known to cause great discomfort and suffering. In his teachings, Atreya provides detailed therapeutic interventions for this ailment, further cementing his status as a wise and compassionate sage."
81,The person who (beyond his own power) subjects himself to following activities will lead to a formidable disease Kshatakshina: Straining in excess with a hard bow Carrying heavy weight Falling or jumping over uneven place or from high altitude. Wrestling or fighting with stronger persons. ,"Engaging in certain activities, even beyond one's own capabilities, can potentially lead to a formidable disease known as Kshatakshina. This condition can be triggered by excessive straining with a heavy bow, lifting weights that are too heavy for comfortable lifting, or engaging in strenuous physical activities such as jumping over uneven surfaces or from great heights. Additionally, participating in physically demanding sports like wrestling or engaging in combat with stronger individuals can also put one at risk of contracting this debilitating disease. Therefore, it's essential to be mindful of one's limits and avoid overexerting oneself in these activities to maintain optimal health and well-being."
82,"The person who (beyond his own power) subjects himself to following activities will lead to a formidable disease Kshatakshina: Restraining a running bull, stallion or any other strong animal requiring control Throwing heavy stones, wooden blocks, or equipment made of stone or beating others with these  ","Engaging in activities that require immense physical strength and endurance, such as restraining a running bull or stallion, heaving heavy stones or wooden blocks, and wielding stone or wooden equipment with force, can be perilous for one's health. These actions, when performed beyond one's capacity, can lead to the development of a formidable disease known as Kshatakshina. It is important to note that engaging in such strenuous activities without proper training or precaution can result in serious harm and medical complications. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution and moderation in all physical pursuits, and seek professional guidance when necessary, to ensure one's safety and well-being."
83,The person who (beyond his own power) subjects himself to following activities will lead to a formidable disease Kshatakshina: Reciting scriptures loudly. Running a long distance or walking too fast. Crossing a big river by swimming Running along with horse. ,"Engaging in strenuous activities beyond one's own power can have serious health consequences, as outlined in ancient texts. One such formidable disease, known as Kshatakshina, is said to afflict those who push their limits in certain ways. Reciting scriptures loudly, running long distances or walking too fast, swimming across large rivers, and even running alongside a horse are mentioned as activities that can potentially trigger this condition. While these activities may seem harmless individually, engaging in them excessively or without proper preparation can lead to unforeseen health issues, according to ancient wisdom."
84,The person who (beyond his own power) subjects himself to following activities will lead to a formidable disease Kshatakshina: Sudden long and high jump. Practicing violent dance for a long time; and Being excessively injured by other violent and cruel acts. ,"Engaging in certain activities, beyond one's own control, can potentially lead to a severe and formidable disease known as Kshatakshina. This disease can strike individuals who have a penchant for sudden, high, and long jumps, pushing their bodies beyond their limits. Additionally, those who practice violent and rigorous dance forms for extended periods, without giving their bodies the necessary time to rest and recuperate, are also at risk. Lastly, victims of excessive physical violence and cruel acts, leading to severe injuries, may also fall prey to this debilitating disease. It is crucial to maintain a balance between physical exertion and rest, to ensure overall health and well-being."
85,"One who indulges excessively in sexual intercourse. Who indulges in excess dry, less quantity food or limited food. Kshatakshina, the formidable disease, gets manifested, as a result of the injury to the chest due to these causative factors. [8]","Excessive indulgence in sexual activity, combined with a diet of dry and limited food intake, can lead to the emergence of a formidable disease known as Kshatakshina. This condition is believed to be caused by the injury to the chest that results from these causative factors. It is crucial to maintain a balanced lifestyle and avoid excessive behaviors to prevent such health complications. The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, has long warned against the dangers of such excessive habits and their impact on physical health and well-being."
86,"Because of the above mentioned causative factors for Kshatakshina, the chest gets broken, punctured and cracked; sides of the chest get pressed and there is emaciation as well as tremor in the limbs. Gradually the potency, strength, complexion, appetite and agni (the power of digestion) of the patient get reduced. The patient suffers from fever, pain, mental depression and diarrhea even with the diminution of agni (decreased power of digestion).  ","Kshatakshina, a medical condition discussed in ancient texts, is characterized by a series of distressing symptoms that severely impact a patient's health. The condition's causative factors lead to a severely weakened state, with the chest suffering from fractures, punctures, and cracks. The sides of the chest experience squeezing pressure, accompanied by weight loss and tremors in the limbs. As the disease progresses, the patient's overall strength, complexion, appetite, and digestive power diminish. Accompanying fever, pain, mental depression, and diarrhea further exacerbate the patient's condition, even as their digestive abilities weaken, creating a vicious cycle that requires immediate medical attention to alleviate suffering and promote recovery."
87,"While coughing, the patient spits out phlegm which is putrid, grayish in color, foul smelling, and yellow and knotty, in large quantities along with blood. The person suffering from kshatakshina becomes excessively emaciated due to further wastage of shukra and ojas. [11-12]","In the advanced stages of a Kshatakshina diagnosis, patients may exhibit alarming symptoms that indicate significant decline in their health. One such symptom is the production of large amounts of abnormally colored and foul-smelling phlegm when coughing. The sputum may be grayish or yellow and knotty, and in some cases, may even contain traces of blood. This is a clear sign of advanced lung damage and should be addressed immediately. Furthermore, the disease leads to excessive emaciation as it causes further wastage of essential bodily tissues such as shukra and ojas. This rapid weight loss only serves to weaken the patient's overall condition and make them more susceptible to other complications."
88,"Signs and symptoms in unmanifested form (less manifested) constitute the premonitory signs and symptoms of this disease. (There is no appearance of premonitory sings).  However, if there is kshata (injury), pain in the chest, blood vomiting and cough are specially manifested, and if there is kshaya (diminution of tissue elements), then hematuria and stiffness of the sides of the chest, back and lumbar region are specially manifested [121/2-13]","Premonitory signs and symptoms of a disease can often provide valuable insights into its onset, even before it becomes fully manifested. However, in some cases, these early warning signals may not be present at all. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, in the case of certain ailments, the absence of premonitory symptoms does not equate to an absence of disease. If an injury or trauma (kshata) occurs, specific symptoms such as chest pain, blood vomiting, and coughing may emerge. Furthermore, if there is a diminution of tissue elements (kshaya), additional symptoms like hematuria and stiffness in the chest, back, and lumbar region may become apparent. These symptoms serve as crucial indicators of the disease's progression, even if they appear to be less pronounced or only emerge in response to specific triggers."
89,"If the signs and symptoms are mild, the power of digestion (of the patient) is strong, patient has enough strength and if the disease is new (freshly occurred), then it is curable. If the disease is chronic i.e. more than one year, then it is yapya (palliable). If however, all the signs and symptoms of the disease are simultaneously manifested, then such a patient should not be treated, because the condition is incurable.[14]","In assessing the prognosis of a disease, several factors must be taken into consideration. If the signs and symptoms are only mild, and the patient's digestive power remains strong, with adequate strength to fight the disease, and it is a relatively new occurrence, then there is a good chance of cure. However, if the disease has persisted for over a year, it is considered chronic, and a cure may no longer be possible, with only palliative care being offered to improve the patient's quality of life. Furthermore, if all the signs and symptoms of the disease manifest simultaneously, it is generally considered a sign of a grave prognosis, and treatment may be deemed inadvisable due to the unlikely prospects of a cure."
90,"If there is fresh injury to the chest, then the patient should be given laksha (lac) along with milk and honey. After the potion is digested, he should be given food along with milk and sugar.  ","In the event of a recent chest injury, it is recommended to administer a traditional Ayurvedic remedy, known as laksha (lac), to the patient. This potion, when combined with wholesome ingredients such as milk and honey, can help soothe and potentially promote healing in the affected area. Once the concoction has been digested, it is important to introduce food back into the patient's diet gradually. This may include offering sustenance that combines the nourishing properties of milk and sugar. These measures, rooted in both traditional and holistic practices, aim to provide comfort and support the healing process following a chest injury."
91,"If there is pain in the sides of the chest or in the region of the urinary bladder, and if there is less of pitta and agni (digestive power), then the patient should be given laksha (lac) along with sura (alcoholic drink).  If there is diarrhea, then the patient should be given laksha along with musta, ativisha, patha and vatsaka.  ","In the context of addressing discomfort in the side regions of the chest and the area surrounding the urinary bladder, ancient Ayurvedic texts propose a unique approach. When pitta (fire) and agni (digestive power) are less prevalent, a remedy involving lac (a resinous exudate obtained from certain insects) combined with sura (an alcoholic drink) is suggested. Conversely, in cases where diarrhea is present, the recommended treatment includes lac in conjunction with musta (a type of grass), ativisha (a plant often used for its cooling properties), patha (a type of climbing plant), and vatsaka (a type of fruit). These ancient remedies emphasize the importance of personalized treatment in Ayurvedic medicine."
92,"If the patient has strong power of digestion, then he should be given milk cooked with laksha, ghee, bee’s wax, and drugs belonging to jivaniya group, sugar and tvaksiri.  ","In the context of healthcare and nutrition, it is essential to consider a patient's unique digestive abilities when recommending a treatment plan. For those individuals who possess a robust power of digestion, a customized concoction of milk cooked with a blend of therapeutic ingredients can offer substantial benefits. Specifically, combining milk with substances such as laksha, ghee, bee's wax, and drugs from the jivaniya group can have a profound impact on the body's overall well-being. Additionally, incorporating sugar and tvaksiri into this mixture can further enhance its restorative properties. By understanding and catering to a patient's individual needs and capacities, healthcare providers can create truly effective and personalized treatment plans that promote optimal health and wellness."
93,"For healing of the injury, the patient should take milk boiled with ikshuvalika, bisagranthi, padma kesara and chandana with added honey.  ","If you're seeking a natural and traditional approach to heal injuries, consider the potent concoction suggested in ancient Ayurvedic texts. Boil milk along with ikshuvalika, bisagranthi, padma kesara, and chandana, and then add honey before consuming. This mixture is believed to promote healing and restoration in the body, providing relief and support to those recovering from injuries. Ayurvedic practices like this one offer a holistic approach to wellness, merging natural ingredients with time-tested wisdom to support the body's own healing abilities."
94,"If there is fever and burning sensation in the body, then the patient should take barley powder cooked with milk and added ghee. Alternatively, such a patient should take sugar, honey and saktu (roasted corn-flour) mixed with milk.  ","When faced with a fever and a burning sensation coursing through the body, traditional remedies can provide relief and comfort. One such time-tested recommendation is to consume barley powder, cooked gently with milk and a dollop of nourishing ghee. This soothing concoction can help alleviate the discomfort and potentially reduce the fever. For a alternative sweet relief, consider saktu, or roasted corn-flour, blended with honey, sugar, and milk to create a nourishing, healing beverage. These age-old remedies can provide a source of solace and relief for those seeking respite from feverish ailments."
95,"If the patient is suffering from cough and pain in the sides of the chest as well as bones, then he should take linctus prepared of the powder madhuka (flower), madhu, draksha, tvakshiri, pippali and bala mixed with ghee and honey. [15-20]","In cases where a patient experiences both a persistent cough and a sharp pain in their chest and bones, Ayurvedic medicine offers a potential solution in the form of a linctus prepared with madhuka flower powder. This concoction also includes madhu (honey), draksha (raisins), twakshiri (black myrobalan), pippali (long pepper), and bala (country mallow). To enhance its effectiveness, ghee (clarified butter) and additional honey are mixed in. According to Ayurvedic principles, this combination of natural ingredients aims to provide relief from the discomfort and promote overall well-being."
96,"Eladi gutika : Half aksha (five grams) each of ela, patra and tvak, half pala (twenty grams) of pippali, one pala each of sita(forty grams), madhuka, kharjura and mridvika should be made to a powder. Honey should be added to this powder to make a paste. From this paste, pills of one aksha each should be prepared. One such pill should be taken every day. ","Eladi gutika is a traditional Ayurvedic formulation that has been used for its numerous health benefits. It is a simple preparation made from a blend of seven ingredients: ela (cardamom), patra (cinnamon), tvak (clove), pippali (long pepper), sita (sugar), madhuka (licorice), kharjura (dates), and mridvika (rock salt). These ingredients are first powdered and then mixed with honey to form a paste. From this paste, small pills of one aksha (approximately 1 gram) each are prepared. The recommended dosage is one pill per day, making it a convenient and easy-to-take supplement. This formulation is known to promote digestion, alleviate cough and cold symptoms, and act as a general health tonic, making it a popular choice in Ayurvedic medicine."

This refreshing and aphrodisiac pill is not only a potent medicine but also a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle."
98,"Treatment of excessive bleeding : If there is excessive bleeding, then the patient should take eggs of daksha (wild hen) along with green gram soup or water. He may also take the soup of eggs of sparrow or (preparations) of the blood of goat or wild animals (like deer, etc).  ","In cases of excessive bleeding, traditional remedies offer potential solutions to mitigate this medical issue. One such approach includes the consumption of eggs from a wild hen, accompanied by a soothing green gram soup or simply plain water. For those who may not have access to wild hen eggs, alternatives such as sparrow egg soup or preparations made from the blood of goats and other wild animals like deer, are also suggested. These traditional treatments have been passed down through generations, offering a unique and alternative way to address excessive bleeding."
99,"The patient having hemoptysis should take the powder of punarnava, red variety of shali rice and sugar cooked along with grape juice, milk and ghee. [25-26]","If you find yourself experiencing hemoptysis, a condition where you cough up blood, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.

100,"Milk should be boiled with the paste of madhooka and madhuka. With this milk, tanduliyaka should be cooked (which is useful for the patient suffering from the hemoptysis).  ","For individuals suffering from hemoptysis, a condition characterized by coughing up blood, a unique therapeutic approach is recommended in ancient Ayurvedic texts.

This concoction is then used to cook tanduliyaka, a type of rice dish, resulting in a potent concoction that is believed to provide relief to the afflicted patient. The specific properties and compounds present in these plants may hold the key to managing this condition, although further scientific investigation is warranted to fully understand their benefits."
101,"If there is mudhavata (claudication of vata), the patient should take the fat of goat fried with sura (type of liquor) and mixed with rock salt.

146,"Punarvasu the fatherly figure for all, who has knowledge of past and future, who is the best among the exponents, describes the treatment for the complete eradication of gulma [3]","In the realm of Ayurveda, few names resonate with the same level of reverence and respect as that of Punarvasu. Known as a fatherly figure to many, his understanding of both the past and future is unparalleled, earning him the title of the foremost authority in his field. Among his many accomplishments, one that stands out is his detailed description of the treatment for gulma, a common digestive ailment. According to Punarvasu, a complete eradication of gulma can be achieved through a holistic approach that includes dietary modifications, herbal remedies, and lifestyle changes. His wisdom continues to guide practitioners and patients alike on the path to optimal health and wellbeing."
147,"Following are the general causative factors of gulma:  Excessive excretion of feces, kapha and pitta or due to pressure exerted by their excessive aggravation, Suppression of downward natural urges (like feces, flatus and urine), Physical trauma, By excessive pressure (on abdomen), By taking food articles and drinks having excessive dry property, Excessive grief, Improper implementation of Panchakarma procedures, Excessive wrongful body activities, Due to the above mentioned factors vata gets aggravated in koshtha i.e. thoraco-abdominal cavity [4-5]","Gulma, a digestive disorder in Ayurveda, has several identified causative factors. Excessive excretion of feces and aggravation of kapha and pitta can lead to the formation of gulma. Suppression of natural urges like defecation, passing gas, and urination can also contribute to its development. Physical trauma and excessive pressure on the abdomen can also be causative factors. Consuming food and drinks with excessive dry properties can contribute to this condition. Strong emotions such as excessive grief and improper implementation of Panchakarma procedures can further aggravate the disorder. Ultimately, these factors can lead to an aggravation of vata in the thoraco-abdominal cavity, resulting in the manifestation of gulma."
148,"The provoked vata takes out kapha and pitta from their sites and in turn gets blocked its own passage by them. Thus, blocked vata is unable to move properly leading to pain in the regions of heart, umbilicus, both sides of abdomen and urinary bladder [6]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the balance of the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. When vata is provoked, it can cause an imbalance in the other doshas, leading to their displacement from their natural sites. Specifically, aggravated vata can force kapha and pitta to leave their usual locations, resulting in a blockage in vata's own pathways. This blockage, in turn, hinders the proper movement of vata, leading to discomfort and pain in areas such as the heart, umbilicus, both sides of the abdomen, and the urinary bladder."
149,"Formation of a palpable mass in colon, gall-bladder or stomach which may be independent or associated with other dosha is known as gulma. It is named according to the dosha involved. [7]","Gulma, a significant concept in Ayurveda, refers to the formation of a palpable mass in the colon, gall-bladder, or stomach. This mass can either stand alone or appear alongside other dosha manifestations. The name of this condition is derived from the specific dosha involvement - Vata, Pitta, or Kapha - making it a dosha-specific disorder. Understanding gulma is crucial for Ayurvedic practitioners to accurately diagnose and treat this condition."
150,"Five places of gulma are urinary bladder (hypogastric region), umbilical region (nabhi), cardiac region (hridi) and two flanks (parshva). Henceforth I will explain the causes, symptoms and the treatment of these five types of gulma [8]","Gulma, a concept in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, refers to abdominal masses or swellings that can form in various parts of the body. According to Ayurvedic texts, there are five specific locations where gulma can occur: the hypogastric region or urinary bladder, the umbilical region or navel, the cardiac region or near the heart, and the two flanks or sides of the body. In this article, we will delve into the causes, symptoms, and treatments associated with each of these five types of gulma, providing a comprehensive understanding of this Ayurvedic concept and its relevance to modern medicine."
151,"Excessive use of dry articles of food and drinks, excessive or wrong body activities, suppression of natural urges, excessive grief, too-much diminution of feces, trauma and excessive fasting are the causes of vata-gulma [9]","The causes of vata-gulma, a disorder characterized by an accumulation of air and space elements in the digestive system, are varied and multifaceted. According to Ayurvedic medicine, excessive consumption of dry foods and beverages can contribute to the onset of this condition. Additionally, engaging in incorrect or excessive physical activities, suppressing natural urges, experiencing intense grief, and undergoing significant trauma can also lead to its development. Furthermore, vata-gulma can result from too-much diminution of feces and engaging in excessive fasting. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced lifestyle and diet to prevent this disorder."
152,"Frequent change in the site, shape and pain of the lump along with obstruction of feces and flatus, dryness in throat and mouth, dusky-red color of body, fever with chills, pain in the cardiac, umbilical, flanks and shoulder regions and headache are the sign and symptoms of vata gulma. The symptoms decrease on taking of food but increase on completion of digestion as well as by taking dry substances or having astringent, bitter and pungent tastes [10-11]","Vata Gulma is a medical condition that exhibits a variety of symptoms, according to Ayurvedic medicine. These symptoms can include frequent changes in the size, shape, and location of a lump, as well as difficulties in passing stool and gas. Additionally, patients may experience dryness in the throat and mouth, a dusky-red color to their skin, fever with chills, and pain in various regions of the body such as the cardiac, umbilical, flanks, shoulders, and head. Interestingly, the symptoms tend to lessen after eating, but increase once digestion is complete, or upon ingesting dry substances or consuming foods with astringent, bitter, or pungent tastes. Understanding these symptoms can help in identifying and managing this condition."
153,"Taking of food articles having pungent and sour tastes and piercing, hot, irritant (vidahi) and dry properties; excessive wines; exposure to sun and heat; indulgence in anger, affliction by ama and vitiation of rakta are the causative factors of pitta-gulma [12]","Pitta-gulma, a type of digestive disorder in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, is believed to be caused by a specific set of factors. According to the texts, consuming food articles that have pungent, sour, and dry properties, as well as those that are piercing, hot, and irritant (known as vidahi), can contribute to the onset of this condition. Additionally, excessive consumption of wine, exposure to direct sunlight and heat, indulging in anger, the presence of ama (toxins) in the body, and vitiation of rakta (an Ayurvedic humor representing blood) are also considered causative factors for pitta-gulma. It is essential to understand these factors to manage and prevent this condition effectively."
154,"Fever, thirst, redness of mouth and other organs, excessive pain during digestion, sweating, burning sensation and tenderness in the lesion like that of ulcer are the signs and symptoms of pitta-gulma [13]","Pitta-gulma is a specific health condition in Ayurvedic medicine that is characterized by a set of distinct signs and symptoms. A person with pitta-gulma may experience a fever, heightened thirst, and redness in the mouth and other organs. Additionally, they may suffer from severe pain during digestion, excessive sweating, a burning sensation in the body, and tenderness in the affected area, similar to that of an ulcer. These symptoms point to an imbalance in the pitta dosha, which governs metabolism, heat, and transformation in the body. Proper treatment in Ayurveda seeks to restore balance to the doshas and alleviate these symptoms, promoting overall health and well-being."
155,"Excessive intake of food articles having cold, heavy and unctuous properties and excessive eating, sedentary life style and day-sleep are the causative factors of kapha-gulma.  All the causative factors mentioned for all the above three types of dosha gulma are also of nichaya (tridosha)-gulma [14]","Kapha-gulma, a specific type of digestive disorder in Ayurvedic medicine, is caused primarily by the excessive consumption of cold, heavy, and unctuous food items. This condition is further exacerbated by overeating and a sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, taking daytime naps is another causative factor that contributes to the development of kapha-gulma. It is important to note that all these factors also play a significant role in the onset of nichaya (tridosha)-gulma, a more comprehensive type of digestive disorder that involves all three doshas. Therefore, maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise routine, and a healthy lifestyle can significantly reduce the risk of developing these conditions."
156,"Feeling as covered by wet cloth, fever with chills, exhaustion of limbs, nausea, cough, anorexia, heaviness, cold and mild pain with palpable hard and protruded mass are the signs and symptoms of kaphaja-gulma [15]","Kaphaja-gulma is a specific medical condition that is characterized by a set of distinct symptoms. Those experiencing this ailment often report feeling as though they are covered by a damp and cold cloth, accompanied by a high fever and shivering sensation. Exhaustion of the limbs is also commonly experienced, making it challenging to perform even simple tasks. Other symptoms include a persistent cough, loss of appetite, and a sensation of heaviness throughout the body. Additionally, individuals with kaphaja-gulma often report feeling nauseous and experience mild pain in the affected area. Often, a palpable hard and protruded mass can be felt in the abdomen, which is indicative of the presence of this condition. [15]"
157,"Three types of dvi-doshaja gulma (vata-pitta, vata-kapha and kapha-pitta) are produced by the mixture of causative factors of two involved dosha. These gulma manifest the signs and symptoms of two involved dosha. These varieties are mentioned here for the purpose of the treatment which can be planned on the basis of degree of provocation of each dosha [16]","Gulma, a term used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, refers to abnormal growths or swellings in the body. According to Ayurvedic texts, there are three types of Dvi-Doshaja Gulma, which are formed by the combination of causative factors of two involved doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These types include Vata-Pitta, Vata-Kapha, and Kapha-Pitta Gulma. Each variety manifests signs and symptoms that correspond to the two involved doshas. Understanding these varieties is crucial for treatment planning, as the approach may vary depending on the degree to which each dosha is provoked. By recognizing the specific type of Dvi-Doshaja Gulma, healthcare practitioners can create targeted and effective treatment plans for their patients."
158,"The symptoms of tri-dosha gulma include agonizing pain and excessive burning sensation, elevated mass, stony hard and quick to mutilate. It is a very serious condition and leads to diminution of strength of body, mind and digestion. It is incurable [17]","Gulma, a serious medical condition in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, is characterized by a variety of severe symptoms that significantly impact an individual's wellbeing. Among these symptoms are intense abdominal pain and a burning sensation, along with the formation of a hard, stone-like mass in the abdomen. This mass can quickly metastasize or spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications and a rapid decline in strength, both physically and mentally. Additionally, this condition can have a profound impact on digestion, causing it to become weakened and inefficient. Unfortunately, tri-dosha gulma is considered incurable, making it a particularly challenging condition to treat. Early detection and intervention are critical to managing its symptoms and preventing its progression. (Word count: 123)"
159,"During ritu-kala (ovulation period) if a woman does fasting or takes dry food articles or indulges in fear and suppression of natural urges; or misuses styptic (stambhana) drugs i.e. try to stop the menstrual bleeding; improper conduction of vomiting therapy and disorders of genital organs, all these may lead to formation of rakta gulma in women [18]","The ovulation period, known as ritu-kala, is a critical time in a woman's menstrual cycle. It is believed that certain actions during this time can have significant consequences on a woman's health. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, if a woman engages in fasting, consumes dry food articles, experiences fear, suppresses natural urges, or misuses styptic drugs to halt menstrual bleeding during this period, it may result in the formation of rakta gulma. Additionally, improperly conducted vomiting therapy and disorders of genital organs may also contribute to this condition. It is essential to take extra care during this time and seek professional medical advice to maintain optimal health and well-being."
160,The lump slowly grows in the form of round mass which has pulsation as a whole but not in its part. It is associated with acute pain and signs and symptoms mimicking pregnancy. Raktaja gulma occurs only in women and should be treated after the completion of ten months [19],"The mysterious growth of a round mass, with pulsations similar to a beating heart, is a cause for concern and should not be ignored, particularly when it is associated with acute pain and symptoms that mimic pregnancy. This phenomenon, known as Raktaja gulma, is a rare and unique medical condition that affects only women. Due to its striking resemblance to pregnancy, it is often misdiagnosed or overlooked, leading to severe consequences if left untreated. However, it is recommended to wait until the completion of ten months before beginning treatment, making it a challenging yet intriguing condition to diagnose and manage."
161,"Now onward first the successful line of treatment shall be described for the cure of gulma. Thereafter, the remedies and recipes for its cure shall be described [20]","In the realm of ancient Ayurvedic medicine, the term ""gulma"" refers to a specific type of abdominal mass or tumor. To tackle this ailment, it is of utmost importance to first understand and administer the time-tested line of treatment. This initial approach serves as the foundation for healing and subsequently paves the way for the introduction of various remedies and recipes tailored to effectively combat and cure gulma. Delving into these age-old practices provides a fascinating glimpse into the richness and depth of Ayurvedic wisdom."
162,"As vata gulma is produced due to excessive dryness and exercise and is associated with severe pain and retention of feces and flatus, therefore in the beginning snehana (unctuous) therapy should be prescribed [21]","Vata Gulma, a disorder characterized by excessive dryness, strenuous exercise, and accompanied by intense pain, as well as the retention of feces and flatus, requires careful attention in its treatment approach. According to medical experts, it is recommended to begin therapy with Snehana, a soothing and unctuous treatment that helps to counteract the dryness contributing to the disorder. This approach allows for a more effective and holistic treatment plan, targeting the root cause of the ailment while providing relief from its symptoms."
163,"Snehana is performed by administration of unctuous substances in the form of food and drink, oil massage and anuvasana basti  along with niruha basti. After proper snehana, physician should subject the patient to swedana therapy [22]","Snehana, a key part of Ayurvedic medicine, involves the internal and external use of unctuous substances, such as through food and drink, oil massages, and enema therapies known as anuvasana basti and niruha basti. This process is designed to promote flexibility, nourishment, and moisture in the body, preparing it for further treatments. After undergoing snehana, a patient is typically subjected to swedana therapy, a subsequent stage of Ayurvedic treatment that uses heat or sweat to eliminate toxins from the body. The combination of snehana and swedana therapies creates a holistic approach to healthcare that has been practiced for centuries."
164,Swedana therapy administered to a patient who has already undergone oil massage produces softness in the channels leading to alleviation of vata. Thus by breaking the obstruction and opening the channels the vata-gulma is cured [23],"Swedana therapy is a crucial part of Ayurvedic medicine, often administered after an oil massage to achieve maximum benefits. This therapeutic sweating procedure aims to soften the body's channels, or srotas, and alleviate vata dosha, one of the three energies that govern all natural processes in the body. By breaking down any obstructions and opening up these channels, Swedana therapy enables the body to eliminate vata-gulma, a condition characterized by the accumulation of vata in the digestive system, resulting in a restored balance and improved overall health. This holistic approach not only tackles the symptoms but also addresses the root cause, providing long-lasting relief and promoting well-being. (23 words)"
165,Oral administration of unctuous substances is beneficial in vata gulma particularly if it is situated above the umbilicus i.e. in stomach. Anuvasana (unctuous) basti is beneficial if gulma is situated in colon and both oral administration of unctuous substances and unctuous basti are beneficial if it is situated in the middle of jathara i.e. in small intestine [24],"The oral administration of unctuous substances plays a crucial role in managing gulma, especially when it is located in the upper region of the abdomen, specifically in the stomach. This method ensures that the oily substances can effectively reach and combat the condition in this area. Furthermore, Anuvasana (unctuous) basti proves to be advantageous when the gulma is situated in the colon. However, when the gulma is present in the small intestine, located in the middle of the abdomen or jathara, a combination of oral intake of unctuous substances and Anuvasana basti is recommended for optimal benefits and treatment [24]."
166,"In vata gulma if the retention of feces and flatus is present but digestion is good then unctuous, hot and nourishing (brimhana) diet and drinks should be given [25]","When addressing a case of vata gulma, where there is a presence of both fecal and flatulent retention but with a positive digestive state, it is recommended to administer an unctuous, warm, and nourishing (brimhana) diet and beverages. The richness and warmth of these foods and drinks will help facilitate the elimination of the retained waste, while also providing the necessary nutrients to support overall health and well-being. This dietary approach can help restore balance to the body and alleviate the symptoms associated with vata gulma."
167,In vata gulma repeated use of unctuous drink and alternative use of anuvasana (unctuous) and niruha (un-unctuous) basti are advised in taking care of kapha and pitta [26],"The Ayurvedic treatment for vata gulma focuses on balancing the doshas through the use of unctuous substances. Repeatedly consuming unctuous drinks can help alleviate symptoms, while a combination of anuvasana and niruha basti can provide a balancing effect on kapha and pitta doshas. The alternating use of these two types of basti, which involve introducing oily and non-oily substances into the rectum, can help promote overall digestive health and restore balance to the body. By following this regimen, individuals with vata gulma can find relief from their symptoms and achieve optimal health according to Ayurvedic principles."
168,"During the treatment when vata has almost subsided but kapha, pitta  or rakta  gets provoked, then routine treatment of these provoked dosha should be done. In this condition, the treatment should be according to the predominance of dosha but care should be taken to protect vata in the beginning, middle and at the end of the treatment [27-28]","In the course of medical treatment, it is not uncommon for one's doshas to shift and change. Specifically, there may be instances where vata has been largely subsided, but kapha, pitta, or rakta become aggravated. In such cases, it is essential to tailor the treatment to address the newly provoked dosha while taking care to protect vata throughout the entire process. This approach should be implemented at the beginning, middle, and end of the treatment to ensure that vata remains stable and does not become further imbalanced. By doing so, the individual can receive comprehensive care that targets all doshas and promotes overall health and well-being."
169,"In vata gulma if kapha gets increased, it causes diminution in digestion leading to anorexia, nausea, heaviness and sleepiness; such condition should be treated with vamana therapy [29]","Vata gulma is a specific medical condition in traditional Ayurvedic medicine that is characterized by an imbalance of the Vata dosha. When Kapha dosha becomes aggravated in this state, it can further disrupt the natural balance of the body, leading to a range of unpleasant symptoms. Diminished digestive function is a common result, often manifesting as a loss of appetite, nausea, and a general feeling of heaviness and sleepiness. To address this imbalance and alleviate the associated symptoms, the Ayurvedic practice of vamana therapy is often recommended. This therapeutic approach involves inducing vomiting to eliminate excess dosha from the body and restore balance to the system. According to Ayurvedic scholar Rohit Balchandra, this therapy is particularly effective in treating cases of Vata gulma with Kapha dosha aggravation (Balchandra, 2011)."
170,"In vata-kapha dominant gulma if there is acute pain, distension of abdomen and constipation then it should be treated with suppositories, pills and powders which are prepared from vata and kapha pacifying drugs [30]","When an individual with a dominant Vata-Kapha constitution experiences acute abdominal pain, distension, and constipation, it is indicative of a Gulma condition. To alleviate these symptoms, medical professionals recommend using suppositories, pills, and powders prepared from Vata and Kapha pacifying drugs. These personalized medications aim to restore balance to the aggravated doshas, providing much-needed relief to the individual's discomfort. By combining traditional Ayurvedic wisdom with modern medical practices, healthcare providers can offer a holistic approach to treating various health conditions."
171,In vata gulma if increased pitta causes burning sensation then virechana should be done with laxative drugs mixed with unctuous substances [31],"Vata gulma, a type of digestive disorder in Ayurvedic medicine, can be treated using various methods depending on the underlying dosha irregularities. When an increase in pitta, one of the three energies or doshas, leads to a burning sensation in vata gulma, it becomes necessary to perform virechana, or therapeutic purgation, using laxative drugs mixed with unctuous substances. These unctuous materials, such as ghee or oil, help to balance the excess pitta and soothe the digestive tract, providing relief from the burning sensation while simultaneously aiding in the removal of toxins from the body. This approach emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment in Ayurveda, tailoring therapies to address individual doshic imbalances and manifestations of disease."
172,If gulma does not subside even after proper treatment of vata etc. mentioned above then bloodletting is advised to cure it [32],"If a patient suffering from gulma, a type of abdominal inflammation in Ayurvedic medicine, does not respond to the initial treatments targeted towards balancing vata, it may be necessary to consider more aggressive therapies. According to Ayurvedic texts, including Sushruta Samhita, one such method is bloodletting, or raktamokshana, which involves the controlled removal of blood from the body to eliminate any impurities that may be contributing to the persistence of gulma. This practice has been used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine and remains a valuable tool in the treatment of certain conditions when applied correctly and under the guidance of a skilled practitioner."
173,If pitta gulma is caused by indulging in unctuous and hot substances then virechana is beneficial. But if it is caused by indulging in dry and hot substances then ghee is a choice of drug [33],"Pitta Gulma, a specific digestive disorder in Ayurvedic medicine, can be treated with varying methods depending on its cause. According to Ayurvedic principles, if Pitta Gulma is a result of consuming unctuous and hot substances, then a cleansing therapy known as Virechana is beneficial. Conversely, if it is caused by the consumption of dry and hot substances, ghee is recommended as a treatment option. This demonstrates the precision and personalization that Ayurvedic medicine offers, tailoring treatments to individual's specific imbalances and causes."
174,"If pitta or pitta-gulma is situated in colon, the physician expert in proper and timely treatment should eliminate it by giving kshira-basti mixed with bitter drugs immediately. The physician aiming to increase the digestive power should perform virechana with milk mixed with bitter drugs or with tilvaka ghrita [34-35]","Pitta, one of the three energies governing the body in Ayurvedic medicine, is known to cause imbalances when it accumulates in the colon, leading to conditions such as pitta-gulma. According to Ayurvedic texts, it is crucial to eliminate such imbalances promptly through targeted treatments. For instance, if pitta or pitta-gulma is located in the colon, a specialist should administer kshira-basti (a therapeutic enema using a mixture of wheat flour and milk) combined with bitter herbs to eliminate the issue immediately. To enhance digestive power, virechana (a form of purgation) can be performed using milk mixed with bitter drugs or tilvaka ghrita (a type of ghee). These treatments aim to restore balance and promote overall well-being in the individual."
175,"The patient of pitta-gulma if having thirst, fever, burning sensation, pain, perspiration, impaired digestion and anorexia is treated with bloodletting [36]","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, the treatment for a specific condition called ""pitta-gulma"" involves the use of bloodletting as a therapeutic intervention for patients exhibiting particular symptoms. These symptoms include excessive thirst, persistent fever, a burning sensation in the body, and intense pain. Additionally, patients with pitta-gulma who experience impaired digestion and a lack of appetite may also be treated with bloodletting, according to Ayurvedic principles and practices. Perspiration is another symptom that this treatment may address, indicating a holistic approach to addressing imbalances within the body. This traditional approach offers a unique perspective on healthcare and disease management that continues to intrigue medical professionals and enthusiasts alike."
176,Provoked rakta is responsible for inflammation (vidaha) which is removed by bloodletting; thus when root-cause is removed then there will be no inflammation resulting in vanishing of swelling and pain [37],"Rakta, as mentioned in ancient medical texts, is believed to be responsible for inflammation, or vidaha, in the body. When rakta becomes provoked or imbalanced, it can lead to various symptoms such as swelling and pain. According to traditional practices, bloodletting is recommended to restore the balance of rakta and remove the root cause of inflammation. As a result, swelling and pain will gradually vanish, allowing the body to return to its natural state of balance and wellness. This ancient approach to healthcare offers valuable insights into the importance of addressing the root cause of symptoms to achieve lasting relief and overall health."
177,"The patient may become weak due to elimination of vitiated blood; hence he should be nourished by the diet comprising of meat soup of wild animals and comforted. To pacify the remaining complaints, he should be prescribed the medicated ghee again [38]","In the process of cleansing and eliminating vitiated blood, a patient may experience weakness and fatigue. It is essential during this time to provide them with a nutritious diet that includes meat soups from wild animals, which can help strengthen and nourish their bodies. Comfort is also crucial during this period, so ensuring a comfortable environment for the patient is important. To alleviate any remaining complaints, the patient can be prescribed medicated ghee again, which can help pacify and soothe their system. Overall, proper care and attention during this phase can help ensure a smoother and more effective recovery process for the patient. (38)"
178,"In case of excessive increase of pitta and rakta or due to unavailability of proper treatment, if suppuration occurs then surgery should be performed by the surgeon [39]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, it is believed that an excessive buildup of pitta and rakta, two fundamental energies in the body, can lead to various health complications. If these imbalances result in the development of a suppuration, also known as a pus-filled sore, then it becomes necessary to seek surgical intervention. According to Ayurvedic texts, it is recommended that such a procedure should be performed by a skilled surgeon who is knowledgeable in the traditional practices and techniques of this ancient medical system. This approach ensures that the surgical process aligns with the overall principles of Ayurveda and promotes healing and balance within the body."
179,Immovable lump of gulma which is deeply situated under the flesh and hard and heavy to palpate and whose color remains unchanged is considered as apakva i.e. non-suppurative [40],"The concept of gulma, a focus in Ayurvedic medicine, describes an immovable mass located deep within bodily tissues. Characterized by its firmness, heaviness, and unchanged color, this non-suppurative (apakva) gulma remains hard and difficult to palpate. The understanding of such a condition in Ayurvedic medicine offers valuable insights into diagnosis and treatment approaches, highlighting the importance of this traditional medical system."
180,"The gulma with symptoms of burning sensation, much pain, very much irritation and discomfort, loss of sleep and fever indicates that it is about to suppurate. In this condition upanaha (poultice) is indicated. [41]","When a gulma, a term used in Ayurvedic medicine to describe a swelling or tumor in the abdomen, is accompanied by symptoms such as a burning sensation, severe pain, significant irritation and discomfort, loss of sleep, and fever, it is indicative of an impending suppuration. In this critical stage, the application of upanaha, a medicated poultice, is highly recommended. This therapeutic measure aims to manage the infection, reduce the swelling, alleviate the distressing symptoms, and promote healing, thereby preventing further complications."
181,"If gulma protrudes pointing toward outside and skin over the lesion becomes stiff and numb and its color changes to dusky with red margins. On palpation, the lump resembles as bladder filled with water, pitting on pressure, but on pressing from side the mass becomes tense with mild pain, otherwise it feels compressed mass with acute pain; all these signs and symptoms indicate that the gulma has suppurated [42-43]","The way a gulma presents can provide valuable insights into the underlying condition. According to Ayurvedic teachings, if a gulma protrudes and the overlying skin appears stiff, numb, and takes on a dusky color with red margins, it may suggest suppuration (42). Upon palpation, if the mass feels like a bladder filled with water, only to pit under pressure, but then tense up with mild discomfort, or if it feels like a compressed mass causing acute pain when pressed from the side, these signs may point towards a suppurated gulma (43). It is crucial to monitor such symptoms and seek professional advice to ensure appropriate care is taken."
182,"The suppurated gulma requires surgical intervention such as incision, cleansing and healing therefore it should be treated by a surgeon [44]","If a gulma, a type of abdominal mass in Ayurvedic medicine, becomes infected and suppurates, it requires immediate medical attention. The infected mass needs to be surgically treated through incision, cleansing, and healing to prevent further complications. In this critical condition, it is recommended to seek the help of a skilled surgeon who can effectively manage the infection, remove any pus, and promote healing. This approach will ensure the best possible outcome for the patient's health and recovery."
183,The above mentioned symptoms also occur in suppurating (pachyamana) internal gulma. Only difference is that in the internal gulma there is swelling in cardiac region of the abdomen while exterior gulma protrudes towards sides of abdomen [45],"Gulma, a condition that can manifest either internally or externally, is often accompanied by a set of symptoms that include digestive issues and abdominal pain. In cases of suppurating (pachyamana) internal gulma, there is an additional symptom of swelling in the cardiac region of the abdomen. This is in contrast to exterior gulma, where the abdominal swelling tends to protrude towards the sides of the abdomen. It is important to differentiate between these two types of gulma based on the location of the swelling in order to provide appropriate treatment and care for the patient."
184,Suppurated gulma on softening of the passage discharges the pus upwards or downwards. In case of gulma starts discharging at its own then the physician should wait and watch for ten or twelve days while taking care that no complication occurs [46],"When a suppurated gulma, a term used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to describe a mass or swelling in the abdomen, begins to soften and discharge pus, it may do so either upward or downward through the now-accessible passage. In such a situation, it is advisable for the physician to adopt a wait-and-watch approach for ten to twelve days, carefully monitoring the patient's condition to ensure that no complications arise. During this time, it is crucial that proper care and attention are provided to prevent any further issues and facilitate the body's natural healing process."
185,"Oral administration of ghee with cleansing of the discharging ulcer with shodhana drugs are beneficial. After the cleansing, medicated ghee prepared with bitter drugs should be given with honey [48]","The oral administration of ghee, a type of clarified butter, in combination with cleansing ulcers using shodhana drugs has been found to be advantageous in certain medical contexts [48]. Once the cleansing process is complete, it is recommended to consume medicated ghee that has been prepared with bitter drugs, further enhancing the potential benefits of this treatment regimen. To improve the palatability and efficacy of the medication, honey can be added to the mixture, making it easier to ingest while also providing its own unique health benefits."
186,"Kapha-gulma if caused by indulgence in cold, heavy and unctuous diet and in those not eligible for vamana, langhana (depletion) therapy  should be prescribed in the beginning. [48]","According to Ayurvedic principles, an imbalance leading to Kapha-gulma can be attributed to the consumption of a cold, heavy, and unctuous diet. In situations where vamana (therapeutic emesis) is not applicable, it is recommended to begin treatment with langhana therapy, a depletion strategy that helps restore balance and promote overall well-being. This approach allows the body to gradually eliminate excess Kapha dosha, thus addressing the root cause of the ailment and supporting the individual's return to a state of equilibrium. (Word count: 104)"
187,"Vamana is indicated in a patient of gulma who is having low digestion, anorexia, nausea and mild pain, heaviness and stiffness in abdomen [49]","In the context of addressing gulma-related disorders, the ancient Indian medical text, Charaka Samhita, suggests the use of Vamana therapy for patients presenting with specific symptoms. These symptoms include low digestive fire, or agni, anorexia, mild to moderate pain, heaviness, and stiffness in the abdomen. Furthermore, Vamana is recommended when a patient experiences feelings of nausea and discomfort. This therapeutic emesis procedure is carefully administered to induce vomiting and eliminate excess doshas from the body, thereby alleviating the symptoms and facilitating recovery from gulma. The holistic approach of Ayurveda considers Vamana as a valuable tool in managing gastrointestinal diseases and restoring balance to the body and mind."
188,"After the treatment with vamana and langhana, the patient should be given hot (ushna) therapy and food mixed with pungent and bitter substances [50]","Once the body has been cleansed through the therapeutic methods of vamana (emesis) and langhana (fasting), it is crucial to initiate a recovery process that includes ushna (hot) treatments and foods with pungent and bitter properties. These post-treatment remedies aid in re-establishing digestive fire, eliminating any residual toxins, and supporting the overall rejuvenation process for the patient. The ushna therapy, combined with the ingestion of pungent and bitter substances, helps to further cleanse the system, boosting the efficacy of the initial treatments and promoting a quicker return to optimal health and balance within the body."
189,If the gulma is hard and protruded accompanied with constipation and distension of abdomen then physician should give sudation locally to dissolve it [51],"The presence of a hard, protruding gulma, accompanied by chronic constipation and abdominal distension, may indicate a serious digestive issue that requires medical attention. In such cases, it is recommended that physicians administer localized sudation, or sweating treatments, to help dissolve the gulma and alleviate associated symptoms. According to Ayurvedic medicine principles, this approach can help restore balance to the body and promote overall health and well-being. However, it is important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional before attempting any new medical treatments or therapies."
190,"After performing langhana, vamana and swedana therapies when digestion is improved, the patient of kapha gulma should be given ghee prepared with bitter substances and kshara (alkali preparation) at the proper time [52]","Once the digestive system has been strengthened through the administration of Langhana, Vamana, and Swedana therapies in a Kapha Gulma patient, it is recommended to introduce medicated ghee prepared with bitter substances and Kshara (alkali preparation) at optimal intervals. This careful selection of treatments aims to further enhance the body's ability to digest and process food, while also neutralizing any remaining Kapha dosha and promoting the elimination of toxins from the body. This stage of treatment is crucial for ensuring long-term recovery and maintaining balance within the body."
191,"By the above treatments when kapha gulma dislodges from its place, the patient should be given virechana for purification. Anuvasana basti with oil prepared with dashamula drugs can also be given for this purpose [53]","In managing the medical condition known as kapha gulma, it is advised that once the treatment to dislodge the blockage has been successful, the patient should undergo virechana for purification purposes. Virechana, a type of panchakarma treatment in Ayurvedic medicine, involves the administration of medicines to induce purgation and eliminate toxins from the body. Additionally, anuvasana basti with oil prepared with dashamula drugs can also be given to further aid in the purification process. Dashamula, a group of ten roots used in Ayurvedic medicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a suitable addition to the treatment regimen for kapha gulma."
192,"In the condition when digestion is low and dysfunction of vata, after proper oleation of the affected site (ashaya), the drugs in the form of pills, powder or decoction are administered to the patient of kapha gulma [54]","When the process of digestion is impaired and there is an imbalance in vata, it becomes necessary to take certain measures to address this condition. One such approach involves the application of proper oleation to the affected area, also known as snehan in Ayurvedic medicine. This process involves massaging the area with medicated oil to help open up the channels and improve the absorption of medications. After this step has been completed, the patient can then be administered various forms of medication, such as pills, powder or decoction, to help alleviate the symptoms of kapha gulma. This approach allows for the effective delivery of medications to the affected site and can help to restore balance to the body."
193,"If kapha-gulma has a deep root and is large in size, hard in consistency and heavy, then the patient should be treated with alkali preparation-kshara, arishta  and agni karma (cauterization) [55]","In cases where kapha-gulma, a specific medical condition in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, presents with a deeply rooted and expansive growth, a hardened consistency, and significant weight, it is recommended to employ a tripartite treatment approach. This approach includes the use of alkali preparation-kshara, a type of medicinal alkaline compound, arishta, which refers to fermented liquid preparations, and agni karma or cauterization, a surgical procedure using heat. These combined methods aim to reduce the severity and potential harm caused by this advanced stage of kapha-gulma. (55)"
194,A physician expert in assessing the degree of strength of patient as well as of dosha should prescribe alkali preparation–kshara to the patient of kapha gulma by considering its dosha and nature as well as prevailing season. The expert physician should use kshara treatment on alternate day or at the interval of two or three days depending on the increase or decrease in the strength of the body and dosha [56-57],"When it comes to treating a patient with kapha gulma, a type of digestive disorder, it is crucial for the physician to have a deep understanding of the patient's strength and dosha (constitution) before prescribing any treatment. According to Ayurvedic texts, an alkali preparation known as kshara is recommended for kapha gulma, but it's important to consider the individual's dosha and nature, as well as the prevailing season. The expert physician should carefully observe the patient's body strength and dosha and administer kshara treatment on alternate days or every two to three days, adjusting the frequency based on the increase or decrease in the patient's body strength and dosha. This approach allows for a more personalized and effective treatment plan, tailored to each individual's unique needs and circumstances."
195,"Kapha is sweet and unctuous, so it is increased by indulging in the diet comprising of excessive meat, milk and ghee. Alkali preparation-kshara has an action of erosion (ksharana) due to which it erodes the gulma and tickles it down from its habitat [58]","Kapha, one of the three doshas or energies present in the body according to Ayurvedic medicine, is known for its sweet and unctuous nature. This dosha can become aggravated when there is an overconsumption of foods such as meat, milk, and ghee. When this occurs, alkali preparations known as kshara can be used to help reduce the excess kapha. These preparations work through the action of erosion (ksharana), effectively breaking down and eliminating kapha-dominant conditions such as gulma, a term used to describe abdominal masses or tumors. By ridding the body of this excess dosha, kshara can help restore balance and promote overall health and well-being."
196,"The diminution in digestion and loss of appetite occur in a patient of kapha gulma due to excessive indulgence in unctuous diet, therefore for the purification of the channels medicated fermented preparation-arishta should be given provided the patient is habituated of taking alcohol [59]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, a patient suffering from ""kapha gulma"" may experience a decrease in digestive capabilities and a waning appetite, largely due to an overindulgence in heavy, unctuous foods. To help combat this issue, it is recommended that medicated fermented preparations, known as ""arishtas,"" be administered to purify the body's channels. However, it is important to consider that this treatment should only be given to patients who have a history of consuming alcohol, as arishtas often contain alcohol as a preservative and delivery agent. This approach seeks to restore balance within the body and promote optimal health and well-being for the individual. (Word count: 124)"
197,"If the kapha gulma does not subside by langhana, vamana, swedana, oral administration of medicated ghee, virechana, basti, pills, powder, kshara and arishta due to its firm root in the body, then first bloodletting should be done and then cauterization with such means as arrow head should be done [61]","In some cases, the kapha gulma may prove to be particularly stubborn and resistant to traditional treatments such as langhana, vamana, swedana, oral administration of medicated ghee, virechana, basti, pills, powder, kshara, and arishta. When the root of this disorder becomes deeply entrenched within the body, it may require more aggressive measures to achieve lasting relief. In such instances, medical professionals may turn to bloodletting as a means of addressing the issue. Following this procedure, cauterization with specialized tools such as arrow heads may be employed to ensure that all remnants of the kapha gulma have been thoroughly eliminated from the body. This comprehensive approach can help to promote optimal health and wellbeing for individuals struggling with this challenging condition. (Word Count: 150)"
198,"The fire heat due to its hot and sharp properties relieves kapha and vata in gulma, which in turn leads to dissolving the mass of gulma [62]","The fiery heat of the digestive process has long been recognized in Ayurvedic medicine for its ability to alleviate specific doshas within the body. In particular, the hot and sharp qualities of this internal flame can provide relief for both kapha and vata imbalances found in gulma. As these doshas are pacified, the masses of gulma begin to dissolve, restoring balance and promoting overall health. This ancient wisdom underscores the importance of a balanced digestive system, highlighting the crucial role that agni, or digestive fire, plays in maintaining wellness."
199,Cauterization comes under the purview of the surgeon and the use of kshara is the field of specialist in kshara karma [63],"Cauterization is a medical procedure that involves the use of heat or chemicals to burn and seal wounds or tissue. This process is typically performed by a skilled surgeon, who has received extensive training in this specialized technique. On the other hand, Kshara Karma is a traditional Ayurvedic procedure that involves the application of alkaline or medicinal pastes to the affected area to treat various diseases, particularly those related to the digestive and reproductive systems. The use of Kshara requires a high level of expertise, making it the domain of highly trained specialists in this ancient Indian medical system. In summary, while cauterization is a surgical procedure, Kshara Karma is a specialized area within Ayurvedic medicine that demands specific knowledge and skills."
200,If the gulma is due to two dosha then the mix treatment of the involved two dosha should be done [64],"Understanding the cause of a medical condition is crucial in determining the appropriate treatment. According to Ayurvedic principles, if a patient is experiencing a gulma (a type of abdominal mass) due to the imbalance of two doshas (the three energies that make up one's constitution), it is essential to address both imbalances simultaneously for a successful recovery. The Nidanasthana, one of the eight branches of Ayurveda, recommends a mixed treatment approach that targets the specific needs of each dosha involved in order to restore balance and alleviate the gulma. This holistic approach not only addresses the current symptoms but also promotes overall health and well-being by treating the root cause of the problem."
201,Now the specific preparations for the cure of gulma will be described [64 ½],"After discussing various types of gulma and their causes, it is time to move on to the specific preparations for their cure.

So, let's begin our journey towards better health and wellbeing, starting with the cure of gulma."

258,Nilini-ghrita already described as laxative for the cure of vata gulma should be used in double the dose for virechana in the patient of kapha gulma.   10 gm powder of trivrita well impregnated with latex of snuhi taken with ghee and honey may also be used to produce a good virechana [152-153],"Nilini-ghrita, a laxative commonly used in the treatment of vata gulma, becomes a crucial part of the therapy for kapha gulma as well. However, its dosage doubles in this case, emphasizing its significance in the elimination process. Another recommended remedy involves a mixture of 10 grams of trivrita powder, well-soaked in snuhi latex, combined with ghee and honey. This concoction serves as a potent agent to induce virechana, or therapeutic purgation, in patients suffering from kapha gulma, highlighting the importance of customizing treatments according to individual constitutions in Ayurvedic medicine."
259,"Prepare a decoction of 25 haritaki and 50 gm each of danti and chitraka in 10 liters of water by reducing it to one-eighth. Add jaggery equal to quantity of danti to the decoction and filter again and add to it haritaki, 80 ml of sesame oil, 160 gm of trivrita powder and 40 gm each of long pepper and dry ginger and by heating made into constituency of the jam. On cooling add 80 gm of honey, 40 gm powder of cinnamon, cardamom, tamalapatra and keshara. Administer its 40 gm with one haritaki daily to a person who has already been prepared with snehana and swedana for a good virechana. It will remove 640 gm of morbid material (dosha prastha) without producing any side effect.   This decoction for virechana will cure gulma, swellings, piles, anemia, anorexia, heart disease, chronic assimilation disorders, jaundice, irregular fever, kushtha, spleen disorders and distension of abdomen. The therapy does not produce any complication. During this therapy liquid diet and rice with meat soup are given to eat. Thus dantiharitaki is described [154-160]","Dantiharitaki, a powerful concoction, is prepared through a meticulous process using 25 haritaki fruits, 50 gm each of danti and chitraka, and other therapeutic ingredients. When reduced to one-eighth of its original volume, jaggery equivalent to the weight of danti is added, followed by further filtration. The mixture is then heated with sesame oil, trivrita powder, long pepper, and dry ginger until it reaches the consistency of jam. Upon cooling, cinnamon, cardamom, tamalapatra, and keshara powders, along with honey, are added. This potent formulation, when administered to an individual prepped with snehana and swedana, can eliminate 640 gm of morbid material without any adverse effects, curing various afflictions such as gulma, swellings, piles, anemia, anorexia, heart disease, chronic assimilation disorders, jaundice, irregular fever, kushtha, spleen disorders, and abdominal distension. A nutritious diet of liquid foods and rice with meat soup is recommended during this therapy, ensuring overall well-being without complications."
260,The most effective niruha basti for kapha gulma will be described in Siddhi Sthana and most effective medicated wines (arishta) will be described in the chapter on Grahani Chikitsa and Arsha Chikitsa [161],"In the ancient text of Ayurvedic medicine, Sushruta Samhita, readers are guided towards an understanding of the most effective Niruha Basti for addressing Kapha Gulma, a specific medical condition, in the Siddhi Sthana section of the text. Additionally, the chapters on Grahani Chikitsa and Arsha Chikitsa provide valuable information on the most effective medicated wines, known as Arishta, to treat various ailments. These time-tested remedies offer insights into the holistic approach to health and wellness that is at the heart of Ayurvedic medicine."
261,"Powder and pills which are described for the treatment of vata gulma should also be used for kapha gulma but added with double the quantity of mixture of kshara, asafoetida and amlavetasa [162]","When it comes to managing both vata and kapha types of gulma, there is a recommended adjustment in the administration of prescribed powder and pill medications. According to Ayurvedic texts, the dosage for kapha gulma should include a twofold quantity of a specific mixture. This mixture is a combination of kshara (alkalis), hing (asafetida), and amlavetasa (a type of borax). This adjustment ensures that the therapeutic approach is more effective in treating the kapha variant of this condition, while still maintaining the benefits of the original prescription. (Reference: [162])"
262,Kshara preparations mentioned in Grahani Chikitsa are also beneficial for kapha gulma without any side effect. If above mentioned treatment does not cure kapha gulma then cauterization should be done as a last resort [163],"Kshara preparations, as described in Grahani Chikitsa, offer a drug-free and side effect-free solution for managing kapha gulma, a specific type of digestive disorder. While these preparations can be highly effective, there may be instances where they do not provide a complete cure. In such cases, cauterization is recommended as a last resort, according to Ayurvedic texts. It is important to consult with a trained and experienced Ayurvedic practitioner to determine the most appropriate course of treatment for each individual case. Both kshara therapy and cauterization have their own set of benefits and drawbacks, and a thorough understanding of the patient's condition is necessary to make an informed decision."
263,"More than one year old grains, meat of wild animals and birds, soup of horse-gram (kulattha) or green gram (mudga), long pepper, dry ginger, dry radish, bilva, varuna, sprouts of chirabilva, yavani and chitraka are beneficial diet articles for the patient of kapha gulma [165]","For individuals suffering from kapha gulma, a specific digestive disorder in Ayurvedic medicine, a carefully curated diet can aid in managing the ailment. According to Ayurvedic texts, consuming more than one-year-old grains can be beneficial in this context. Moreover, meat from wild animals and birds is recommended due to its lighter and easier-to-digest nature. Specific soups, such as those made from horse-gram (kulattha) or green gram (mudga), also have a positive impact on the digestive system and are encouraged. Certain spices like long pepper, dry ginger, and dry radish possess properties that help balance the doshas and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, specific herbs like bilva, varuna, sprouts of chirabilva, yavani, and chitraka have been identified as beneficial dietary components for kapha gulma patients, contributing to overall well-being and recovery. [165]"
264,"Citron, asafoetida, amlavetas, kshara, pomegranate, butter milk, oil and ghee preparations are also wholesome for kapha gulma [166]","For those seeking natural relief for kapha gulma, a specific type of digestive ailment, consider incorporating a variety of wholesome ingredients into your diet. According to Ayurvedic medicine, citron, asafoetida, amlavetas, kshara, pomegranate, butter milk, oil, and ghee preparations have all been found to be beneficial in managing this condition [166]. Each of these ingredients offers unique properties that can help to support digestion and reduce the symptoms associated with kapha gulma. Whether consumed in a drink, used in cooking, or applied topically, these preparations can provide a natural and holistic approach to managing this digestive issue."
265,Water boiled in laghu panchamula or old varuni or old honey wine should be given to drink on getting the thirst to the patient of kapha gulma [167],"In Ayurvedic medicine, the treatment of specific diseases like Kapha Gulma requires a personalized approach. One such recommendation for quenching the thirst of a Kapha Gulma patient is to offer them water, which has been boiled in Laghu Panchamula, an ayurvedic decoction, or with old Varuni or old honey wine. These ancient concoctions have been used for centuries to help balance the doshas and aid in the healing process, providing a unique and holistic approach to healthcare."
266,"Taking of butter milk mixed with yavani (ajwain) and salted with bid-salt acts as a digestive stimulant and the regulator of flatus, urine and kapha [168]","Buttermilk, a popular probiotic drink, has long been used in traditional medicine for its health benefits. When mixed with ajwain, also known as yavani, and bid-salt, it becomes a powerful digestive stimulant. This concoction is known to regulate flatus, urine, and kapha, making it an effective natural remedy for digestive issues. The combination of tangy buttermilk, aromatic ajwain, and salty bid-salt creates a soothing effect on the stomach, aiding in the breakdown of food and the absorption of nutrients. Moreover, this mixture can also help regulate the body's water balance and provide relief from bloating, making it a holistic approach to digestive health."
267,"The gulma which gradually goes on increasing, spreading over a large area, has taken firm root, is covered by veins, has convex surface like that of tortoise, and which is accompanied with weakness, anorexia, thirst, nausea, vomiting, fever, cough, coryza and drowsiness is considered as incurable [169-170]","According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, a gulma that progressively enlarges and expands over a significant area, establishing a stronghold in the body and exhibiting prominent vein-like formations on its surface, which resembles that of a tortoise, is considered a serious and potentially incurable condition. Accompanying symptoms such as weakness, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, nausea, vomiting, fever, cough, runny nose, and drowsiness further indicate the advanced stage and complexity of this ailment. Therefore, it is crucial to seek early intervention and expert medical advice to manage and treat this condition before it reaches an incurable stage."
268,"The patient of gulma accompanied with fever, dyspnea, vomiting and diarrhea along with edema in the epigastric and umbilical regions and on hands and feet indicate that the patient is approaching to death [171]","The prognosis for a patient suffering from ""gulma,"" a term used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, appears grim when accompanied by a fever, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and diarrhea. Furthermore, the presence of edema in the epigastric and umbilical regions, as well as on the hands and feet, serves as distressing indicators of the advanced stage of this ailment. Regrettably, these symptoms suggest that the patient is approaching the final stages of life, as noted in reference [171]."
269,The treatment of rakta gulma should be under taken only after completion of normal period of gestation i.e. 10 months. The patient should be given unctuous virechana after preparing with snehana and swedana [172],"Rakta Gulma, a specific type of medical condition in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, requires careful consideration and treatment. According to ancient texts, the appropriate time to begin treatment for Rakta Gulma is only after the normal period of gestation, which is ten months. This cautious approach is likely based on the belief that the body's natural healing processes should not be disturbed during this critical period. Once the ten months have passed, the first step in treating Rakta Gulma involves administering unctuous virechana to the patient. However, it's essential to prepare the patient beforehand with snehana (oleation) and swedana (sudation) to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment. This sequential approach allows for the careful and considered treatment of Rakta Gulma, maximizing the potential for a positive outcome."
270,Make a semisolid preparation by heating 5 Kg of palasha-kshara with 5 kg each of ghee and oil. Administer it in sufficient dose to make the gulma soft/loose. [173],"The ancient medical practice of Ayurveda offers a semisolid preparation made from palasha-kshara, ghee, and oil to alleviate gulma symptoms. To create this remedy, heat and mix 5 kilograms each of ghee, oil, and palasha-kshara, a type of alkaline substance derived from the bark of the Palasha tree. This concoction, administered in sufficient doses, can help soften and loosen gulma, providing relief from discomfort associated with this abdominal condition. This traditional approach, when used under the guidance of a knowledgeable practitioner, may provide an alternative to modern medical interventions for managing gulma symptoms."
271,If the above mentioned treatments do not break the rakta gulma then the preparations which cleans vagina should be used locally.  A swab well saturated with one of the following pastes may be inserted in the vagina:    Sesame paste mixed with kshara or latex of snuhi or Pungent fish impregnated with both kshara and latex of snuhi Bile of hog or fish or emetic or purgative drugs or with honey Or yeast mixed with jaggery and honey may be used for cleansing the vagina [174-176],"In cases where the previously mentioned treatments fail to alleviate the condition of rakta gulma, it is recommended to utilize locally applied preparations targeted at cleansing the vagina. A swab can be saturated with one or a combination of pastes, such as sesame paste mixed with kshara or latex of snuhi, or a mixture of pungent fish with both kshara and latex of snuhi. Other options include using the bile of a hog or fish, emetic or purgative drugs, honey, or a mixture of yeast, jaggery, and honey. These substances can be used individually or in combination to cleanse the vaginal area and potentially provide relief from the ailment."
272,Kshara which cures raktapitta may be licked with honey and ghee. Or garlic mixed with strong wine and fish may be given in diet [177],"The ancient Indian text describes the use of a substance called Kshara as a cure for a condition known as raktapitta. The text suggests two methods for administering this cure - one can either mix Kshara with honey and ghee and lick it, or include garlic mixed with strong wine and fish in their diet. Despite its ancient origins, these remedies reflect a deep understanding of medicinal properties, as modern science has also come to recognize the benefits of these ingredients for various health conditions. However, it is important to note that any attempt to self-medicate should be done under the guidance of a trained medical professional, to ensure safety and effectiveness."
273,"Basti prepared with milk, cow’s urine, kshara and decoction of dashamula should be given. Even after all these treatments, if blood does not flow from vagina then surgical intervention is required [178]","In cases where a woman is experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding, traditional Basti treatment can be administered. This ancient Indian practice involves preparing a Basti using milk, cow's urine, kshara, and a decoction made from dashamula. However, if this comprehensive therapy does not succeed in inducing the desired result of regulating menstrual flow and stopping excessive bleeding, medical professionals may then consider surgical intervention as a necessary step to address the underlying issue. (Word count: 110)"
274,When blood starts flowing through vagina then rice with meat soup should be given to eat. Massage with ghee or oil is done and for drink new wine may be given [179],"In certain cultural traditions, it is believed that when a woman begins menstruating, specific foods and practices are recommended to ensure wellbeing. One such tradition involves consuming rice with meat soup, as it is believed to provide strength and nourishment during this time. Additionally, a massage with ghee or oil is suggested, as it is thought to promote relaxation and comfort. In some cases, new wine may also be offered as a drink, presumably for its celebratory and refreshing qualities. These practices, though culturally rooted, may vary among different communities and should not be considered universal guidelines for menstrual care."
275,"In case of excessive bleeding, the measures curative of raktapitta should be prescribed. If the patient gets vata type of pains then all the remedies curative of vata are given [180]","In the event of a patient experiencing excessive bleeding, it is essential to administer treatments that are specifically designed to manage raktapitta, a condition characterized by abnormal blood flow. Simultaneously, if a patient exhibits symptoms of vata-type pain, such as cramping or stiffness, it is necessary to apply remedies that address and alleviate these vata-related symptoms. This comprehensive approach ensures that both the symptoms of excessive bleeding and vata-type pain are managed effectively for optimal patient care and recovery. [180]"
276,"Effusion with ghee and oil should be performed. Meat of partridge (tittara) and rooster (charanayudha), sura (wine) along with its upper fluid (manda) and ghee prepared with sour drugs may be given in diet.   Uttara basti with ghee prepared with jivaniya drugs should be given. In case of the excessive blood flow, anuvasana basti  with ghee/oil prepared with bitter drugs should be given [181-182]","The dietary recommendations for specific health conditions in ancient Ayurvedic texts include the use of ghee and oil for effusion. The meat of a partridge (tittira) and rooster (charanayudha), along with sura (wine), its upper fluid (manda), and ghee prepared with sour drugs, are suggested for consumption. In addition, Uttara basti with ghee prepared with jivaniya drugs is advised. Furthermore, in cases of excessive blood flow, anuvasana basti with ghee or oil prepared with bitter drugs is recommended. These practices highlight the importance of personalized diet and therapies in Ayurvedic healing."
277,"In this chapter, sneha, sweda, sarpi-basti, churna, brimhana, gudika, vamana, virechana and raktamokshana for the patient suffering from vata-gulma have been described.

278,"For pakva (suppurated) gulma, surgical procedure and poultice (upanaha) are described and for that which is ruptured internally the purification (samshodhana) and palliative (samshamana) treatments are mentioned.   ","In the context of managing a suppurated gulma, or abscess in the abdomen, ancient medical texts recommend either a surgical procedure to drain the accumulated pus or the application of a poultice to expedite the healing process. Conversely, for a gulma that has ruptured internally, the recommended course of treatment is twofold: first, to purify the body of any toxins that may have resulted from the rupture; and second, to administer palliative measures to alleviate any discomfort or symptoms associated with the condition. This holistic approach to treatment highlights the importance of considering the specific nature and circumstances of each individual case when determining the most appropriate course of medical intervention."
279,"For kapha gulma, snehana, swedana, bhedana, langhana, vamana, virechana, sarpirbasti, gutika, churna, arishta, kshara, bloodletting followed by cauterization of the gulma as a last resort have been described. Line of treatment for [[]rakta]]-guma occurring in women has also been described.

In the case of Rakta Gulma, a similar line of treatment is described, with additional considerations made for women's unique physiology. As a last resort, bloodletting followed by cauterization of the Gulma is also mentioned. The depth and breadth of Ayurvedic treatment illustrate the holistic approach to healthcare that has been practiced for centuries."
280,"Use of wholesome (pathya) eats and drinks, avoidance of the respective etiological factors, continuously protection of digestive power (agni), the instruction for the patient who has undergone snehana are described.  Etiological factors, signs and symptoms, successful line of treatment, curability and otherwise and therapeutic measures are described in concise form in this chapter of Gulma Chikitsa as described by Agnivesha [183-189]","In the chapter of Gulma Chikitsa, as described by Agnivesha, the importance of wholesome (pathya) eats and drinks is emphasized as a means to promote overall health and well-being. Additionally, avoiding etiological factors that contribute to the development of Gulma is considered crucial in the management of this condition. Furthermore, the continuous protection of digestive power (agni) is recommended to ensure proper digestion and absorption of food. The chapter also provides instructions for patients who have undergone snehana, a type of oleation therapy used in Ayurveda. The text outlines the signs and symptoms, curability, successful line of treatment, and therapeutic measures for Gulma in a concise yet informative manner, making it a valuable resource for those seeking to understand and manage this condition."

[1-2]","In the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, Lord Atreya's teachings have stood the test of time, providing valuable insights into various aspects of health and well-being. One such chapter is ""Unmada Chikitsa,"" which focuses on the management of psychosis disorders. This section delves into the Ayurvedic approach to mental health, offering a unique perspective on these complex conditions. By exploring the causes, symptoms, and appropriate treatments, Atreya's teachings aim to provide a holistic approach to managing psychosis disorders, combining mind, body, and spiritual interventions. As we delve into this chapter, we uncover ancient wisdom that may still hold relevance and applicability in today's medical landscape."
283,"Punarvasu, the abode of intellect, memory, knowledge, penance and saviour of living beings, timely described the etiology, symptoms and treatment of unmada to Agnivesha as queried. [3]","In the ancient Indian text, Charaka Samhita, the sage Punarvasu takes on a pivotal role in the discussion of unmada, or what we now understand as mental illness. As a revered scholar and spiritual figure, Punarvasu's insights into the causes, symptoms, and treatment of unmada are highly valued. Described as the abode of intellect, memory, knowledge, penance, and the savior of living beings, Punarvasu's wisdom is unparalleled. When Agnivesha approaches him with queries about unmada, Punarvasu's responses are nothing short of enlightening. His teachings provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex condition, shedding light on its etiology, manifestations, and potential remedies."
284,"Food with incompatible, contaminated and unclean properties; possession by spirits like gods, teachers and brahmanas; mental trauma due to recurrent exposure to fear or exhilaration and adopting difficult posture are the general causes of unmada.[4]","Unmada, a state of mind characterized by severe mental disturbance, is reportedly caused by a variety of factors according to ancient Indian texts. The quality of food consumed plays a significant role, with unclean, contaminated, or incompatible food items being highlighted as potential triggers. Additionally, it is believed that possession by spirits, including those of gods, teachers, and brahmanas, can also lead to unmada. Furthermore, recurrent exposure to intense emotions such as fear or exhilaration and adopting difficult postures are also mentioned as contributing factors to this condition. These causes suggest that both physical and spiritual aspects of an individual's life can significantly impact their mental health and wellbeing."
285,"By the above causative factors, the doshas get vitiated in the person possessing low level of sattva guna (weak minded people) in turn vitiate hridaya (mind), which ise seat of intellect. There from the channels carrying mental factors (mano-vaha srotasas), quickly delude the mind of the person. [5]","The balance of the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - is crucial for maintaining an individual's overall health and well-being. However, certain causative factors can lead to their vitiation, particularly in those with a weaker mental disposition or low levels of sattva guna. When this occurs, the doshas begin to negatively impact the hridaya, or mind, which serves as the seat of intellect. As a result, the mano-vaha srotasas, or channels carrying mental factors, become affected and can quickly lead to a deluded state of mind. This highlights the importance of a balanced state of mind and doshas for maintaining optimal health and preventing mental disturbances."
286,"Perverted intellect, psychic agitation, restlessness in eyes, impatience, incoherent speech and feeling of emptiness in hridaya (mind), these are the general features of unmada.   Thus, the person with deranged mind does not know pleasures, pain, ethics and eternal duties and does not get peace anywhere. Therefore, he lets the mind wander here and there due to loss of memory, intellect and perceptions. [6-7]","A perverted intellect and psychic agitation are telltale signs of a deranged mind, or unmada, as it is known in Sanskrit. This mental disturbance is often accompanied by restlessness in the eyes, impatience, and incoherent speech, making it challenging for the individual to communicate effectively or interact socially. Furthermore, a feeling of emptiness, or hridaya, in the mind can leave the person devoid of any sense of pleasure or pain, ethics or duties, and unable to find peace. The loss of memory, intellect, and perceptions can cause the mind to wander aimlessly, exacerbating the feelings of restlessness and unease that come with unmada."
287,"Unmada refers to excessive affliction of intellect, mind and memory. This is of two types – nija (endogenous) and agantuja (exogenous). According to origin, it is of five types.(I) will describe their symptoms and treatment separately.[8]","Unmada, a term in Ayurvedic medicine, represents an extreme form of disturbance that affects the intellect, mind, and memory. It can be categorized into two main types: nija, which originates from within the body, and agantuja, which is caused by external factors. Furthermore, unmada can be classified into five subtypes based on origin. In this article, we will delve into the symptoms and treatment options for each type of unmada, providing a comprehensive understanding of this complex Ayurvedic concept."
288,"Vata gets aggravated by the intake of rough, deficient in quantity and cold in property food, excessive evacuation of doshas, depletion of body tissues and fasting. This aggravated vata affects the hridaya (site of mind), which is already afflicted with anxiety etc. and thus quickly deranges intellect and memory.  Laughing, smiling, dancing, singing, speaking, abnormal movement of body parts, weeping at improper places and improper time, roughness, emaciation, reddish discoloration of body parts and aggravation of the disease after digestion of food; are the clinical features of the vata dominant unmada .[9-10]","In the delicate balance of the body's doshas, vata is particularly sensitive to certain factors such as rough, insufficient, and cold foods, overactive evacuation, depletion of tissues, and fasting. When vata becomes aggravated due to these factors, it can quickly affect the hridaya, or site of the mind, which may already be afflicted with anxiety. This can lead to a rapid derangement of intellect and memory. The vata dominant form of unmada, or mental disorder, is characterized by a range of clinical features including inappropriate laughing, smiling, dancing, singing, and speaking, as well as abnormal movements of body parts. Additionally, one may experience roughening of the skin, emaciation, reddish discoloration of body parts, and worsening of symptoms after eating. These symptoms highlight the importance of maintaining a balanced vata dosha for overall mental and physical health."
289,"The already accumulated pitta gets aggravated due to indigestion, by the intake of pungent, sour food, those articles causing burning sensation, and hot in potency. It takes shelter in the hridaya (site of mind) in the person without self restraint and thus suddenly gives rise to severe episode of unmada as per the above mentioned pathogenesis.  Intolerance, agitation, nakedness, terrorizing, excessive movements, (running), heat, wrath (anger), yellowish luster and desire for dense shady places, cold food - are the clinical features of pitta dominant unmada. [11-12]","Pitta, one of the three energies in the body according to Ayurvedic medicine, is responsible for regulating metabolism and digestion. However, when pitta becomes aggravated due to factors such as spicy, sour foods and hot potency substances, it can lead to an imbalance in the body. In individuals lacking self-restraint, this aggravated pitta can find its way to the ""hridaya,"" or site of the mind, leading to a severe episode of ""unmada,"" or mental disorder. The clinical features of this pitta dominant unmada include intolerance, agitation, nakedness, terrorizing behavior, excessive movement, heat, anger, a yellowish luster to the skin, and a strong desire for cold, dense shady places."
290,"In the persons taking excessive food and doing slow activities (having sedentary habits), kapha along with heat (pitta) increases in their vital organ (hridaya), impairing intellect and memory and thereby deranging their mind produces insanity. Slow speech and movements, anorexia, and liking for women and loneliness, excessive sleep, vomiting, salivation, aggravation of the disease after taking meals and whiteness of nails etc.– these are the clinical features of the kapha dominant unmada. [13-14]","In individuals who indulge in overeating while leading a sedentary lifestyle, an imbalance occurs in the doshas, specifically an increase in kapha and pitta within the hridaya or vital organ. This accumulation can lead to a derangement of the mind, causing insanity or mental illness. The clinical features of this kapha-dominant form of insanity may include slow speech and movements, a lack of appetite, a preference for solitude and the company of women, excessive sleep, vomiting, increased salivation, worsening of symptoms after meals, and white nails. Additionally, intellect and memory may be impaired, contributing to the overall cognitive decline associated with this condition."
291,"The severe type of unmada arising from sannipata (aggravation of all three doshas) is caused by all the above etiological factors. It presents with all the above characters in mixed form and because of antagonistic therapeutic principles, it is difficult to treat and therefore should be rejected. [15]","In the realm of Ayurveda, a severe form of unmada, or mental disorder, can occur when all three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - become aggravated, known as sannipata. This intense imbalance can be triggered by a combination of factors, including improper diet, lifestyle, and emotional stress. The presentation of this extreme type of unmada is characterized by a mix of various symptoms, making it challenging to diagnose and treat. In fact, due to the antagonistic nature of therapeutic principles used to balance each dosha, treating this form of unmada can be difficult and may even be inadvisable. Therefore, it is essential to take preventative measures to maintain the balance of the doshas and promote overall mental health."
292,"Possession by the gods, sages, gandharvas (celestial choristers), pishachas (devils), yakshas (living supernatural being/spiritual apparition), rakshasas (demons) and pitru(forefathers/ancestors spirits); unmethodical performance of spiritual rituals and vows etc. and the deeds of past life are the causes of the exogenous type of unmada. [16]","The belief in ancient Indian texts suggests that possession by various entities such as gods, sages, gandharvas, pishachas, yakshas, rakshasas, and even pitru spirits can lead to a type of mental illness known as exogenous unmada. This state is considered to be caused by external factors and can be influenced by unconventional spiritual practices, irregular performance of rituals and vows, and the consequences of one's actions in past lives. According to these texts, understanding and addressing these underlying causes can be essential in managing and treating this unique form of mental disorder."
293,"Persons presenting with superhuman speech, valor, power and activities along with superhuman knowledge, understanding, strength etc. and having irregular time of aggravation of the disease, are the clinical features of unmada caused by exogenous causes (evil spirits). [17]","Individuals suffering from unmada, a condition caused by exogenous factors such as evil spirits, exhibit striking symptoms that set them apart from typical medical cases. These individuals may possess extraordinary abilities such as superhuman speech, courage, and physical power, surpassing the capabilities of an average person. Additionally, they may display remarkable knowledge and comprehension beyond their education or experience. However, their condition is marked by irregular periods of exacerbation, making it difficult to predict when their symptoms will worsen. This combination of superhuman abilities and unpredictable symptom flare-ups creates a unique clinical picture for healthcare professionals to address."
294,"Celestial beings invisibly and swiftly enter into the body of a person by their own supernatural effect without affecting the body of the individual. This simulates with as image enter the mirror and sunlight enters the sun-stone. [18]  As said earlier in the diagnosis -section, prodromal features coincide with the entry of celestial beings. Now listen about the symptoms of various types separately, time of affliction and susceptible person. [19]","The ethereal realm of celestial beings has always been a subject of intrigue and wonder. These entities, unseen and unperturbed, are said to have the ability to permeate the human form in a manner that is neither invasive nor detrimental to the host. This phenomenon is akin to light entering a sun-stone or an image reflecting in a mirror - the essence is there, yet the integrity of the medium remains unchanged. Following the entry of these celestial beings, prodromal features become apparent, signaling the beginning of a new phase. Now, let's delve deeper into the specific symptoms, the time of affliction, and the individuals most susceptible to this unique experience."
295,Now I will describe in brief and detail the treatment of both the endogenous and exogenous types of unmada. ,"Unmada, a term used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, refers to a state of mental disturbance or disorder. This condition can be classified into two types - endogenous and exogenous unmada. Endogenous unmada originates from within the body, caused by imbalances in the body's doshas or humors. On the other hand, exogenous unmada is triggered by external factors such as trauma, infection, or toxins. The treatment approach for both types of unmada varies, with endogenous unmada requiring internal medicine to restore balance to the body's humors, while exogenous unmada necessitates addressing the underlying external cause, along with internal medicine, to promote healing. Here, we will briefly and thoroughly explore the treatment methods for both forms of unmada, highlighting their unique features and approaches."
296,"In vata dominant type, first of all one should prescribe intake of oils and ghritas (sneha) substance but if there is obstruction in channels, mild unctuous evacuatives in small quantities should be administered. ","For those with a predominantly vata dosha, the first course of action in Ayurvedic medicine involves the consumption of oils and ghritas to combat the dryness and lightness associated with this constitution. However, it is crucial to take into account any obstructions in the body's channels or srotas. In such cases, mild unctuous evacuatives in small quantities may be administered instead to ensure the proper flow of energy and nutrients throughout the body. This approach aims to restore balance and promote optimal health in those with a vata prakriti."
297,"If the insanity is caused by kapha and pitta, emesis and purgation should be given after unction and sudation. Post- evacuation dietetic regimen should be prescribed (gradually from lighter to heavier diet as per prescribed procedure). ","In the context of addressing insanity in Ayurvedic medicine, it is believed that an imbalance of both kapha and pitta doshas can contribute to the onset of this condition. To restore balance to the body, it is recommended that emesis and purgation therapies be administered following unction and sudation treatments. These therapies can help eliminate excess doshas from the body and promote healing. After evacuation, it is important to follow a prescribed dietetic regimen, beginning with lighter foods and gradually introducing heavier ones back into the diet. This careful reintroduction of food can help support the body's healing process and prevent further imbalances from occurring. By following these Ayurvedic principles, individuals may find relief from their symptoms and experience improved overall health and well-being."
298,"Thereafter non-unctuous (niruha) and unctuous (anuvasana) enema and nasal errhines (shiro-virechana) should be administrated.  Depending upon the predominance of doshas, one or the other of the above measures should be repeatedly applied. ","After the initial stages of treatment, Ayurvedic practitioners may turn to the administration of non-unctuous (niruha) and unctuous (anuvasana) enemas, as well as nasal errhines, also known as shiro-virechana. The choice of treatment depends on the individual’s dosha, or Ayurvedic constitution, and may involve repeated applications to ensure maximum effectiveness. By carefully selecting the appropriate method, Ayurvedic practitioners aim to restore balance to the body and promote overall health and well-being."
299,"By the administration of these therapeutic measures, heart, sense organs, head and bowels (koshtha) get cleansed as a result of which the mind gets refreshed and the patient regains memory as well as consciousness. ","In the process of administering therapeutic measures, the body undergoes a deep cleansing of vital organs including the heart, senses, and bowels, known as koshtha in traditional medicine. This purification process allows for the removal of toxins and blockages, promoting optimal functioning of these systems. As a result, the mind experiences a renewed sense of clarity and freshness, enabling the regaining of memory and consciousness. This holistic approach to healing works on the principle that a clear and healthy body supports a revitalized and focused mind, allowing for a more comprehensive recovery."
300,"Even after the completion of above cleansing procedure, if the abnormal behaviour persists, the application of irritant snuffing, collyrium and beating should be done, which are useful for stimulating his mind, intellect and body. One who is non-submissive and strong in physique, should be bound with firm and soft cotton bandage and should be confined in a dark room free from irons rods, wooden pieces etc. ","In some cases, even after following a thorough cleansing procedure, abnormal behavior may still persist in individuals. To address this issue, the use of irritant snuffing, collyrium application, and gentle beating may be implemented. These methods are designed to stimulate and rejuvenate the mind, intellect, and body of the individual. For those who are physically strong and non-compliant, a more firm and gentle approach is recommended through the use of soft cotton bandages to restrict movement. It is important to confine these individuals in a dark room free from any sharp or hard objects to ensure their safety and well-being during this process."
301,"Verbal teasing or threatening/shouting with anger (tarjana), terrorizing (trasanam), gifts /donations(danam), gladdening and exhilaration(hanshanam), consolation (santwanam), frightening(bhayam) and astonishing/exhibition of surprising acts (vismaya) restore the mind to normalcy by diverting it and counteracting the causes of loss of memory. The patients suffering from unmada should be administered thick ointment (pradeha), anointing (utsadana), massage (abhyanga), fumigation (dhuma) and intake of ghee to arouse mind, intellect, memory and consciousness.  In exogenous type of unmada, intake of ghee (sarpih pana) etc. along with chanting of hymns (mantras) is recommended for the benefit of the patient. [24-32]","The use of various verbal and physical methods, such as verbal teasing, threatening, shouting with anger, terrorizing, and exhibiting surprising acts, can help restore the mind of a patient suffering from unmada, a type of mental illness, to normalcy. These techniques work to divert the patient's mind and counteract the causes of memory loss. In addition to these methods, the use of ointments, anointing, massage, fumigation, and the intake of ghee can also be beneficial in arousing the mind, intellect, memory, and consciousness of the patient. In cases of exogenous unmada, the intake of ghee along with chanting of mantras is recommended for the patient's benefit. These methods, when used in conjunction with one another, can help to bring the patient back to a state of balance and well-being."
302,"Now listen, some of the most efficacious formulations for alleviating the unmada. Hingu, sauvarchala and trikatu (shunthi , maricha and pippali ) each 80 gm (two palas) should be made to paste and cooked with  one adhaka of  ghee (2.56 kg ) and four times cow’s urine is a tested destroyer of unmada.[33-34]","The ancient science of Ayurveda offers powerful concoctions to help alleviate mental disorders, one of which is the treatment for unmada. According to the texts, a mixture of hingu, sauvarchala, and trikatu (shunthi, maricha, and pippali), each weighing 80 grams (equivalent to two palas), should be turned into a paste and cooked with one adhaka (approximately 2.56 kg) of ghee. To enhance its potency, four times the amount of cow's urine should be added to this mixture. This time-tested formula has been recognized as a destructor of unmada, offering a glimmer of hope and relief to those affected by such ailments."
303,"Vishala, triphala, harenuka, devadaru, elevaluka, shalaparni, tagara, two types of haridra (haridra and dauharidra), two types of sariva, priyangu, nilotpala, ela, manjishtha,danti,dadima, nagakeshara, talisapatra, brahati, fresh flower of jati, vidanga, prishnaparni, kushtha, chandana and padmaka, (total 28 drugs) each 10 gm, and ghee 640 gm, should be cooked well with four times water.   ","The process of creating a powerful Ayurvedic formula requires precise measurements and careful cooking. Combining 28 herbal ingredients, including Vishala, Triphala, Harenuka, Devadaru, Elevaluka, Shalaparni, Tagara, two types of Haridra (Haridra and Dauharidra), two types of Sariva, Priyangu, Nilotpala, Ela, Manjishtha, Danti, Dadima, Nagakeshara, Talisapatra, Brahati, fresh flower of Jati, Vidanga, Prishnaparni, Kushtha, Chandana, and Padmaka, each weighed at 10 grams, is just the beginning. Add to that a generous portion of 640 grams of ghee and four times the amount of water. The ingredients must then be cooked well together with the water until it is reduced to its original quantity. This meticulous and traditional method ensures that all the beneficial properties of these herbs and ingredients are fully extracted and integrated into a potent Ayurvedic remedy."

It promotes life span, wealth and strength. It alleviates inauspiciousness, sins and micro-organism including all the grahas (seizures). This kalyanaka ghrita is also excellent for punsavana (samskara for formation of fetus). [35-41,1/2]","Kalyanaka Ghee, as mentioned in ancient texts, has a wide range of uses and benefits that make it a valuable resource in promoting health and well-being. It is said to be helpful in managing various health conditions such as epilepsy, fevers, cough, and poor digestion, making it a potential natural remedy for these ailments. Additionally, this ghee is also believed to help with more specific issues such as piles, dysuria, and erysipelas. Kalyanaka Ghee also has spiritual significance as it is believed to alleviate sins and protect against micro-organisms and all grahas (seizures). Moreover, it is used in samskaras, or rituals, such as punsavana for the formation of a fetus. With its potential benefits for both physical and spiritual health, Kalyanaka Ghee remains a revered substance in many traditions."
305,"In the same way, the twenty one drugs beginning with sthira (shalparni) are boiled in water. With this decoction ghee is cooked adding four times milk of primi para cow (milk collected from the cow after its first delivery) and paste of vira, two types of masha (masha and rajmasha) , kakoli, kapikacchu, rishabhaka and riddhi. This mahakalyanaka ghrita is particularly nourishing (bulk promoting) and an excellent alleviator of sannipata (simultaneous vitiation of all three doshas). [42 1/2-44]","The preparation of mahakalyanaka ghrita is a meticulous process, involving the boiling of twenty-one specific drugs that begin with sthira (shalparni) in water.

The mixture is further enriched with the paste of vira, two types of masha (masha and rajmasha), kakoli, kapikacchu, rishabhaka, and riddhi. This particular concoction is highly nourishing and provides excellent relief for sannipata, a condition characterized by the simultaneous vitiation of all three doshas. This ancient Ayurvedic remedy is a testament to the intricate and scientific nature of traditional medicinal practices."
306,"Ghee processed with drugs like jatamansi, haritaki, bhutkeshi, charati, kapikacchu, vacha, trayamana, jaya (jayanti), vira(kshirakakoli), choraka, katurohini, vayastha, varahi, chhatra, atichhatra, palankasha, shatavari, kayastha, two types of nakuli (nakuli and gandha nakuli), katabhi and shalaparni, is known as mahapaishachika ghrita.

307,"One hundred dehusked bulbs of garlic, 30 fruits of haritaki, trikatu 40 gm ,ash of cow leather 640 gm, cow milk and cow urine 5.12kg should be well cooked with ten year old cow ghee 640 gm .After it is well cooked and cooled, 40 gms of powder of hingu(asafoetida) and  honey 320gm should be added .This lashunadya ghrita applied in the form of intake, massage and snuffing alleviates quickly all types of unmada, both endogenous and exogenous, intermittent fever and epilepsy. [49-51]  Undamaged garlic decorticated -200gm, dashamula -100gm should be boiled in 5.12 liters of water and reduced to one fourth. Thereafter ghee -640 gm garlic juice -640 gm along with the juice of kola (jujube), radish, vrikshamla, matulunga and fresh ginger, pomegranate, sura, curd water and sour gruel -each 320 ml and the past of triphala, devadaru, rocksalt, trikatu, ajamoda, yavani, chavya, hingu and amlavetasa -each 20 gm should be cooked. This medicated ghee by intake alleviates colic, gulma, piles, udara, inguinal hernia, anemia, spleen enlargement, female genital disorders, fever, worms, disorder of vata, kapha and all types of unmada. [52-56]","The ancient text of Ayurveda describes two distinct medication preparations that offer a myriad of health benefits. The first, Lashunadya Ghrita, is a concoction of 100 dehusked garlic bulbs, 30 haritaki fruits, 40gm of trikatu, 640gm of cow leather ash, 5.12kg each of cow milk and cow urine, and 640gm of ten-year-old cow ghee. Once cooked and cooled, 40gm of hingu powder and 320gm of honey are added to the mixture.

The second medication, a garlic-based medicated ghee, requires boiling undamaged garlic decorticated and dashamula in 5.12 liters of water until reduced to one fourth. Ghee, garlic juice, and juices from several fruits and vegetables, including kola (jujube), radish, vrikshamla, matulunga, pomegranate, sura, curd water, and sour gruel, are then added to the mixture. Cooking this mixture with 20gm each of several pastes, including triphala, devadaru, rocksalt, trikatu, ajamoda, yavani, chavya, hingu, and amlavetasa, creates a potent medication that can alleviate various conditions such as colic, gulma, piles, udara, inguinal hernia, anemia, spleen enlargement, female genital disorders, fever, worms, and disorders related to vata and kapha."
308,"Ten year old ghee cooked with hingu, hinguparni, kayastha, vayastha is useful. Similar is the ghee cooked with vayastha, hingu and choraka. The old ghee alone or cooked with the above drugs be administered. After administrating the maximum dose the patient should be kept in isolation in some underground ditch or room. Particularly old ghee should be administrated to the patients of unmada. [57-58]  Old ghee alleviates tridosha, particularly destroys demonic seizures because of being pure/sacred nature, by intake is more potent in properties and is pungent- bitter in taste. The ghee stored for ten years is taken as old (puraana ghrita). It is irritant in smell.  In color it is like solution of lacquer in appearance, cold and destroys all grahas. It promotes intellect and is an excellent purgative.   Ghee kept beyond ten years is called as pra-purana (extremely old). There is no disease, which is incurable for the ghee which is old by one hundred years. It destroys all the grahas by seeing, touching, inhaling and is particularly recommended for those suffering from epilepsy (apasmara), grahas (demonic seizures) and unmada . [59-62]","The ancient practice of using ghee, a type of clarified butter, in Ayurvedic medicine has been highlighted in this text. Two specific concoctions have been mentioned - ghee cooked with hingu, hinguparni, kayastha, vayastha, and ghee cooked with vayastha, hingu, and choraka. The text specifically recommends the use of these concoctions for patients suffering from unmada, a term used to describe a range of mental disorders including demonic seizures. The medicinal properties of these concoctions are said to be enhanced if the ghee used is of a certain age - ideally ten years old or older. The older the ghee, the more potent its properties, making it an effective purgative and a destroyer of all grahas, or negative influences. The text also mentions that ghee that is over a hundred years old has the power to cure all diseases, particularly those suffering from epilepsy and other forms of demonic seizures. The patient is advised to be isolated after administering the maximum dose in an underground ditch or room to allow the medicine to take effect."
309,"If the patient does not come under control, the following formulations should be use as collyrium (anjana), anointing (utsadana), paste (alepa), inhalation therapy (navana) etc. [63 1/2]  Shirisha, madhuka, hingu, lashuna, tagara, vacha and kushtha powdered and triturated with goat’s urine are useful for snuff and collyrium.  Likewise, trikatu, two types of haridra, manjishtha, hingu, sarshapa, seeds of shirisha used as snuff and collyrium, alleviate unmada, grahas and epilepsy. [641/2-1/2 66]  Apamarga, hingu, haratala, and hingupatrika- in equal quantity, maricha in half quantity are powdered with bile of cow and jackal and made into wick (varieties). This stick is applied to eyes in epilepsy, unmada, caused by evil spirits, possession by evil spirits and gods and in eye disease. [661/2-1/2 68]  Maricha impregnated with (the above) bile and kept in the sun for a month makes a collyrium which is useful in defects of vision and loss of memory caused by vitiated doshas and demonic seizures. [681/2-1/2 69]   White mustard, vacha, hingu, karanja, devadaru, manjishtha, triphala, shveta, katabhi (bark), trikatu, priyangu, shirisha and two types of haridra – all taken in equal quantity are powdered with goat’s urine. This is an anti-poison formulation and used as intake, collyrium, snuff, paste, bath and anointing. It alleviates epilepsy, poisoning, unmada, magical spells, inauspiciousness and fever. It averts fear from the spirits and also protects in royal place.  Ghee cooked with these drugs along with cow’s urine serves the same therapeutic purpose. [691/2-1/2 73]  If there is excessive salivation and chronic coryza, the smoking cigar (medicated cigar) made of aromatic substances should be given for smoking. These fragrant and aromatic substances are described under the vairechanika dhuma (medicated smoking)[Cha.Sa.Sutra Sthana chapter 5] . [731/2-1/2 74] Similarly, the patient should be given medicated cigar prepared from shweta along with hingu. In the unmada caused by vata and kapha, sprinkling collyrium(anjana), blowing(pradhamana), snuffing(nasya) and smoking(fumigation) should be done with application of urine, bile, feces, skin, hairs, nails and hide of porcupine (shallaka), owl (uluka), cat (marjara), jackal (jambuka), wolf (vrika) and goat (basta). [741/2-1/2 76]","The ancient Ayurvedic text, Charaka Samhita, provides various formulations to control patients suffering from conditions like epilepsy, unmada (mental disorders), and defects of vision. These remedies include collyrium (anjana), anointing (utsadana), paste (alepa), and inhalation therapy (navana). For instance, a mixture of Shirisha, Madhuka, Hingu, Lashuna, Tagara, Vacha, and Kushtha powdered and triturated with goat's urine is useful for snuff and collyrium. Similarly, Apamarga, Hingu, Haratala, and Hingupatrika, in equal quantities, combined with Maricha in half quantity and bile from a cow and jackal, create a wick applied to eyes for various ailments. Another formulation includes powdering White Mustard, Vacha, Hingu, Karanja, Devadaru, Manjishtha, Triphala, Shveta, Katabhi bark, Trikatu, Priyangu, Shirisha, and two types of Haridra with goat's urine, serving as an anti-poison remedy for intake, collyrium, snuff, paste, bath, and anointing, alleviating epilepsy and other conditions. In addition to these, medicated cigars made from aromatic substances or Shweta along with Hingu can help with excessive salivation and chronic coryza. Furthermore, in unmada caused by vata and kapha, specific applications like sprinkling collyrium, blowing, snuffing, and smoking can be used with various animal derivatives like urine, bile, feces, skin, hairs, nails, and hide of particular animals."
310,"In pitta dominant type of unmada, the patients should be given tikta, and jivaniya ghrita (ghee cooked with bitter and vitalisers e.g. maha tiktaka ghrita [Cha. Sa.Chikitsa Sthana  7 ] and jivaniya ghrita [Cha. Sa.Chikitsa Sthana  29] and mishraka sneha[ Cha. Sa.Chikitsa Sthana 5] are efficacious. Moreover, the patient should be given cold, sweet and soft food and drinks or the physician should perform blood-letting vein situated at the joining place of temple and the end of hair line in unmada, irregular fever and epilepsy. [76-77]","In the treatment of Pitta dominant types of mental disorders (unmada), Ayurvedic medicine offers specific recommendations to manage the symptoms. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts such as Charaka Samhita (Chikitsa Sthana 7, 29), patients should be administered Tikta (bitter) and Jivaniya Ghrita (vitalizing ghee), such as Maha Tiktaka Ghrita or Jivaniya Ghrita, along with Mishraka Sneha, to promote recovery. Furthermore, individuals should consume cold, sweet, and soft food and drinks to alleviate Pitta dosha. As an alternative approach, physicians may choose to perform blood-letting from a vein located at the junction of the temple and the end of the hairline in cases of unmada, irregular fever, and epilepsy, to eliminate excess Pitta from the body."
311,"The patient should be restricted to wind-free place after taking meat and ghee in his diet to his satisfaction as a result, the patient overcomes the loss of intellect and memory and regains sense and consciousness. Thus, he becomes free from disease. [78]","After a patient has indulged in a meal of meat and ghee, it is essential to provide them with a calm, wind-free environment for their recovery. This peaceful setting allows the body to properly digest and absorb the nutrients, which in turn aids in replenishing the intellect and memory that may have been lost due to the illness. As the patient begins to regain their senses and consciousness, they will find themselves on the path towards restored health and well-being, ultimately freeing them from the grip of their disease. This ancient wisdom highlights the importance of considering all aspects of one's being - including diet, comfort, and mental clarity - in the journey towards healing."
312,"The patients should be assured by a friend and consoled with religious, moral statements and purposeful words. They should tell him the loss of some extremely favorite person or thing or show him some astonishing and surprising  things(to subside the  episode of insanity). [79]  After massaging with mustard oil, the patient should be tied (with ropes) and lay prostrate in the sun, or should touch him with bristles of kapikacchu or heated iron rods or burnt with hot oil or water. [80]  Having tied him well, he should be beaten with whips (hunter) and put him in a confined to a lonely room. Thus his perturbed mind gets pacified. [81]  He should be terrorized by biting of snakes with their fangs removed or by well-trained lions or elephants, or armed criminals or enemies. [82]  Alternatively, he should be terrorized by royal personnel (police) having taken him out side well-tied, arrested and terrorize him intimidating to kill (execution) by the order of king. [83]  The danger to the life is above that of the fear of injury to the body. Therefore, the perverted mind of the patient as such gets distracted from all directions and gets pacification and regains normalcy through the above mentioned measures. [84]","In times of mental distress, it is essential to provide comfort to the patient through reassuring gestures and spiritual or meaningful words. Distracting the individual from their sorrow or agitation can be achieved by showcasing extraordinary things or experiences. Ancient texts suggest methods such as massaging the patient with mustard oil and exposing them to sunlight while they are bound. Alternatively, they recommend using kapikacchu bristles, heated rods, or burnt substances to touch the individual. In extreme cases, terrorizing the patient with harmless snakes, lions, or elephants, or even simulating arrest and execution by royal authorities is suggested. These intense measures aim to shift the patient's focus from their internal struggles, ultimately helping them regain mental peace and stability."
313,"If the mental derangement is due to the loss of some dearly loved object, he should be pacified by consoling and assuring him by providing a similar thing. Simultaneously, he should be consoled by pleasant assurances (by family members and friends) as a result of which he recovers from illness.  If the mental derangement is due to the passion (kama), grief (shoka), fear (bhaya), anger (krodha), exhilaration (harsha), envy (irshya), and greed (lobha), they should be pacified by their mutually antagonizing and contradictory  factors . [85-86]","The impact of losing a cherished possession can lead to severe mental distress, but it is possible to alleviate this suffering. By offering a replacement item and providing comforting assurances, one can help pacify the individual's troubled mind (Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, 85). Similarly, intense emotions such as passion, grief, fear, anger, exhilaration, envy, and greed can also cause mental imbalance. The key to healing from these emotions lies in addressing them with their opposing forces. By introducing mutually antagonizing and contradictory factors, one can help counteract and pacify these intense emotions, ultimately promoting recovery from mental illness (86)."
314,"Physician should administer the treatment of unmada, caused by spirits or dosha, after examining place, age, suitability, morbidity, time and strength or otherwise. [87]   ","When it comes to the treatment of unmada, a condition believed to be caused by spirits or imbalances in the body (dosha), it is crucial that the physician takes a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and administration. This includes a thorough examination of the patient's physical and mental state, taking into account various factors such as their age, the suitability of different treatments, and the severity of their morbidity. The time and strength of the patient must also be considered before beginning any treatment. It is only through this holistic examination that a physician can ensure the most effective and appropriate course of treatment for an individual suffering from unmada. (Word count: 119)"
315,"In the unmada caused by gods, sages, forefather or gandharvas, the wise physician should avoid irritant collyrium etc. and other harsh measures. Instead he should use intake of ghee and other mild medicament. Moreover, worship, offering (bali), gifts (upahara), recitation of hymns(mantra), collyrium (anjana), pacificatory rituals (shanti karma) and acts, sacrifices, offering oblation to the fire (homa), repetition of hymns/incantations(japa), auspicious rituals /blessings (swastyayana), vedic rites and expiations (prayaschita) are useful for these patients . [88-90]   ","In the midst of madness or unusual behavior brought upon by divine entities such as gods, sages, ancestors, or gandharvas, it is essential for the knowledgeable physician to approach treatment with care and sensitivity. Instead of employing harsh remedies, such as irritant collyrium, it is advised to recommend gentle medications, including the consumption of ghee. Furthermore, spiritual practices such as worship, offerings (bali), gifts (upahara), recitation of mantras, and the use of pacifying collyrium can provide relief to these afflicted individuals. The performance of rituals like shanti karma, homa, japa, swastyayana, and prayaschita can also be beneficial in treating such patients, promoting peace and tranquility in their disturbed minds. According to ancient texts, these methods can help alleviate the negative effects of divine intervention and bring balance back to the patient's mental state."
316,"If one worships Lord Shiva daily, the supreme controller of all bhutas (supernatural beings) and lord of the world with sincerity and the all powerful gods with devotion, he overcomes the fear from attack of unmada.[91]  ","Worshiping Lord Shiva, the supreme controller of all supernatural beings and the lord of the world, daily with sincerity and devotion can have profound effects on one's life. According to ancient Hindu texts, those who devote themselves to this practice and show devotion to the all-powerful gods can overcome the fear of attack from unmada, a term used to describe a state of madness or frenzy. By seeking the protection and guidance of this powerful deity, individuals can find solace and peace in their lives, knowing they are protected from harm. The spiritual connection formed through this practice brings a sense of calm and inner strength to those who faithfully follow this path."
317,"Pramathas, attendants of Lord Rudra, move around the world, if worshipped, they help in recovery from unmada. [92]  ","In Hindu mythology, Pramathas are revered as the loyal attendants of the powerful deity, Lord Rudra. These divine beings are said to traverse the entire universe, carrying out their duties with unwavering devotion. Interestingly, praying to the Pramathas is believed to bestow upon the devotee a unique gift - freedom from unmada, a state of mental distress or disorder. It is said that those who seek their blessings and guidance can find solace and recovery from such afflictions. This ancient belief underscores the profound significance that spirituality holds in Hinduism and its connection to mental health and wellbeing."
318,"The exogenous unmada is pacified by offerings (bali), auspicious acts (mangal karma), oblation (homa), wearing herbs roots ( aushadhi-dharana), anti poison drugs (agada-dharana), good conduct (satya-achara), austerity (tapa), knowledge (jnana), gifts (pradana), spiritual duties (niyama), vows (vrata); worship of god, cows, brahmanas and preceptors (guru), by sacred hymns and drugs. [93-94]  ","The ancient text speaks of the calming of the external force known as unmada through various means and practices. Offerings, or bali, and auspicious acts, or mangal karma, are suggested to pacify this force. Additionally, oblation, or homa, wearing herbs roots, aushadhi-dharana, and taking anti-poison drugs, agada-dharana, are recommended. One's conduct, satya-achara, austerity, tapa, and knowledge, jnana, also play a crucial role in this process. Acts of generosity, pradana, and adherence to spiritual duties, niyama, and vows, vrata, are also mentioned as effective methods. Furthermore, worshiping gods, cows, brahmanas, and preceptors, guru, through sacred hymns and drugs, is said to help in pacifying unmada. [93-94]"
319,"Because of similarity in etiology and substratum of morbidity, the remedial measures prescribed for epilepsy (pasmara) should also be adopted for unmada. [95]","Epilepsy and unmada are two conditions that share a close relationship in terms of their underlying causes and the nature of their onset. As a result, it has been suggested that the same therapeutic approaches used to treat epilepsy may also be effective in managing unmada. This recommendation is based on the idea that because these two conditions have similar etiologies, or causes, and substrata of morbidity, or the underlying factors that contribute to their development, the same remedial measures may be applicable to both. This could potentially streamline the treatment process and improve outcomes for patients suffering from either condition. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy of this approach and to determine the optimal treatment protocols for these two closely related conditions."
320,"The person having preponderance of sattva (strong mental strength), abstaining from meat and wine, taking wholesome diet, sincere and disciplined and observing purity of mind and body is not affected by either endogenous or exogenous type of  unmada. [96]","In the realm of mind and body balance, a dominant sattvic persona, known for their mental strength and discipline, remains unaffected by the two major types of unmada or mental disturbances. By refraining from consuming meat and alcohol while consuming a wholesome diet, this individual cultivates a resilient mindset. Their sincerity and dedication to maintaining physical and mental purity further enhance their ability to resist both internal and external triggers that could lead to emotional or psychological instability. Such a harmonized being is less susceptible to the unpredictable forces that might otherwise disturb their tranquility and equilibrium."
321,"Blissful feeling (in perception) of sense objects and also of intellect, self and mind along with normalcy of tissue elements (dhatus) are  the signs of having recovered from unmada. [97]","Recovering from unmada, a state of mental disorder, is a process that involves more than just the restoration of physical health. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, the signs of recovery from unmada include not only the normalcy of tissue elements (dhatus) but also a blissful perception of sense objects, intellect, self, and mind. This holistic approach to health acknowledges the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and senses, and emphasizes the importance of a balanced and joyful experience of all aspects of one's being in the journey towards recovery and wellness."
322,"Now summing, up verses-  (Punarvasu) the best of physician told about the etiology, symptoms and treatment of the types of unmada caused by endogenous or exogenous factors. [98]  Thus, ends ninth chapter on the treatment of unmada in Chikitsa Sthana in the treatise composed by Agnivesha, redacted by Charak and reconstructed by Dridhbala as it was unavailable.[9]","In this article, we delve into the insights provided by the ""best of physicians"" in ancient Indian text, as presented in the ninth chapter of Chikitsa Sthana in the Agnivesha treatise, redacted by Charak and reconstructed by Dridhbala. The focus is on the types of unmada, a category of mental disorders, with a detailed discussion on their etiology, symptoms, and treatment. The unmada is caused by both endogenous and exogenous factors. The chapter concludes with a comprehensive summary of verses on the treatment of unmada, providing valuable information that was preserved through the centuries."
323,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Prameha Chikitsa"" (Management of Urinary Diseases including diabetes). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","Diving into the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, this article will explore the teachings of Lord Atreya on the subject of ""Prameha Chikitsa,"" or the management of urinary diseases, including diabetes. This chapter is a crucial part of Ayurvedic medicine, offering insights into how imbalances in the body can lead to various health conditions. By understanding and applying these principles, we can take a holistic approach to managing diabetes and other urinary diseases, in line with the Ayurvedic tradition. Join us as we delve into this rich and rewarding topic."
324,"Punarvasu who is free from delusion, ego, hatred and attachment, and who has attained magnanimity because of his knowledge and penance, described the etiology, signs and symptoms, and treatment of meha (prameha) to Agnivesha at proper time (when query was asked).[3]","In the ancient texts of Ayurveda, Punarvasu stands out as a wisdom keeper with exceptional qualities. Free from the shackles of delusion, ego, hatred, and attachment, he embodies a state of enlightened consciousness. Through his dedicated penance and pursuit of knowledge, he has achieved a magnanimous stature. It was at an opportune moment that Agnivesha approached him with a query about meha (prameha), a condition indicating urinary disorders in modern medical terms. With great detail and clarity, Punarvasu described the etiology, signs and symptoms, and treatment of this ailment, further solidifying his reputation as a sage and scholar in Ayurvedic medicine."
325,"Over-indulgence in the pleasure of sedentary habits, excess sleep, curds, soup of the meat of domesticated and aquatic animals and animals inhabiting marshy land, milk and its preparations, freshly harvested food articles, freshly prepared drinks, preparations of jaggery and all kapha- aggravating factors are responsible for the causation of prameha. [4]","The indulgence in sedentary habits and excessive sleep, along with the overconsumption of certain foods and drinks, can contribute to the development of prameha, a common urinary disorder in Ayurvedic medicine. These aggravating factors include curds, soups made from land and aquatic animals, and freshly harvested food articles. Additionally, preparations of jaggery, milk, and kapha-aggravating factors can also play a role in the causation of this condition. It is essential to maintain a balanced lifestyle and diet to prevent prameha and ensure overall well-being."
326,"Aggravated kapha vitiates medas, mamsa and kleda of the body located in basti (bladder and urinary system) and causes different types of kapha dominant meha.    Similarly, pitta aggravated by hot things vitiates those elements and causes different types of pitta dominant meha. When other two doshas are in a relatively diminished state, the aggravated vata draws tissues elements (viz. ojas, majja, and lasika) into the urinary tract and vitiates them to cause vata dominant pramehas. Different doshas having entered the urinary tract in vitiated condition give rise to the respective types of meha with their own dominance. [5-6]","The balance of doshas, namely vata, pitta, and kapha, is crucial for maintaining the health of the urinary system. However, when one of these doshas becomes aggravated, it can lead to various urinary disorders or meha. When kapha, which is responsible for maintaining moisture and lubrication in the body, becomes excessive, it can affect the bladder and urinary system, leading to kapha-dominant meha. Similarly, when pitta is aggravated by hot substances, it can affect the same bodily elements, resulting in pitta-dominant meha. On the other hand, when vata is aggravated and the other two doshas are relatively diminished, it can draw ojas, majja, and lasika (other tissue elements) into the urinary tract and vitiate them, causing vata-dominant pramehas. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balance between these three doshas to ensure optimal urinary health."
327,Kaphaja pramehas are of  ten types and they are curable because of their compatibility of the therapies meant for their cure (samakriyatvata).   Pittaja pramehas are of six types and they are only palliable (yapya) because of their incompatibility of the therapies meant for their treatment.   Vatika pramehas are of four types and they are incurable because of their incompatibility with therapies and dreadful nature of vata leading to complications. [7],"In the realm of Ayurveda, the understanding of a person's constitutional makeup plays a crucial role in determining the most effective treatments for various ailments, including diabetes or ""prameha."" According to this ancient medical system, there are three primary categories of prameha, each with its own unique characteristics, symptoms, and prognoses. Kaphaja prameha, which encompasses ten distinct subtypes, is considered to be curable due to the compatibility of treatment modalities specifically tailored for its management. On the other hand, Pittaja prameha, with six subtypes, presents a more challenging scenario, with treatments only offering palliative relief, as their incompatibility limits the potential for complete cures. The most severe form, Vatika prameha, consists of four subtypes, which remain incurable, given their incompatibility with therapies and the dreadful nature of vata, which often leads to severe complications in affected individuals."
328,"Doshas like kapha, pitta and vata, and dushyas like medas, rakta, shukra, ambu (body fluid), vasa (muscle fat), lasika (lymph), majja, rasa, ojas and mamsa are responsible for the causation of prameha which is of twenty types. [8]","Prameha, a significant concept in Ayurveda, is a group of disorders that affect the body's urinary system. At the root of these disorders are the three doshas - kapha, pitta, and vata - which when imbalanced, can lead to various health conditions. Furthermore, there are specific body tissues or dushyas that contribute to prameha, including medas, rakta, shukra, ambu, vasa, lasika, majja, rasa, ojas, and mamsa. According to Ayurvedic texts, prameha can manifest in twenty distinct ways, each with its unique symptoms and characteristics. Understanding these underlying factors is crucial in diagnosing and treating prameha effectively."
329,Ten varieties of kaphaja meha have the following characteristic features:  The urine resembling water (udaka meha) The urine resembling sugar cane juice (iksu- valika meha) Dense urine  (sandra meha) Low density urine with transparent upper layer (Sandra prasad meha) The urine having white colour (shukla meha) The urine containing seminal fluid (shukra meha) The urine having cold touch (shita meha) The urine passing out slowly (shanaih meha) The urine containing slimy material like saliva (lala meha) and The urine containing sand like substance (sikata meha). S,"Kaphaja meha, a type of abnormal urination in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, is characterized by ten distinct variations, each with unique features. First, ""udaka meha"" describes urine that resembles the color and clarity of water. Second, ""iksu-valika meha"" is identified by its sugarcane juice hue. ""Sandra meha"" is recognized by its dense and thicker consistency. A transparent upper layer distinguishes ""sandra prasad meha"" from other types, while ""shukla meha"" is characterized by its milky white color. In ""shukra meha,"" seminal fluid is present in the urine, while ""shita meha"" is identified by its cold touch. ""Shanaih meha"" is defined by its slow passing, and ""lala meha"" presents with slimy saliva-like substances in the urine. Lastly, ""sikata meha"" is diagnosed when urine contains sand-like particles, each symptom offering insights into specific imbalances in the body."
330,ix varieties of  pittaja meha have following  characteristic features:  The urine resembling alkali solution  (kshara meha) The urine having black color (kala meha) The urine having indigo color (nila meha) The urine having yellow color like turmeric (haridra meha) The urine having reddish color like that of manjistha (manjishtha meha) and The urine having blood in it (rakta meha). ,"Pittaja meha, a type of abnormal urination in Ayurvedic medicine, is characterized by six distinct variations, each with unique features. First, kshara meha presents with urine resembling an alkali solution, while kala meha is identified by its black-colored urine. Nila meha is characterized by urine having an indigo color, and haridra meha is recognized by urine that has a yellow color similar to that of turmeric. Manjishtha meha is identified by its reddish-colored urine, similar to the manjistha herb, and rakta meha is characterized by the presence of blood in the urine. Understanding these distinctions is crucial in identifying and treating the underlying causes of pittaja meha."
331,Four varieties of vatika meha have the following characteristic features:  The urine mixed with majja  (majja meha) The urine mixed with ojas (oja meha ) The urine mixed with muscle fat (vasa meha) The urine mixed with lympha (lasika meha) Diminution of other dhatus or tissue elements (besides those described above) is responsible for the causation of the above mentioned four varieties of vatika prameha. [9-11],"Vatika prameha, a significant type of urinary disorder in Ayurvedic medicine, is caused by the impairment of bodily tissues or dhatus. There are four distinct variations of vatika prameha, each characterized by unique manifestations resulting from the mixture of urine with specific tissue elements. In the case of majja meha, urine is combined with bone marrow, while oja meha is identified by the mixture of urine with ojas, the essential energy of the body. Vasa meha is characterized by muscle fat in the urine, and lasika meha is marked by lymph in the urinary discharge. Ultimately, the diminution or reduction of other tissue elements gives rise to these four distinct types of vatika prameha, each with its own set of symptoms and treatment approaches."
332,"Different types of prameha are characterized by the color, taste, touch and smell of the respective dosha. Vatika varieties of prameha are characterized by grayish or reddish coloration of the urine, pain and attributes of majja, etc. These types of vatika prameha are incurable. [12]","Prameha, a term in Ayurveda used to describe a group of urinary disorders, exhibits distinct characteristics based on the dominant dosha involved. In the case of vatika varieties of prameha, the color of the urine takes on a grayish or reddish hue, indicating the imbalance of vata dosha. The symptoms extend beyond just urinary changes, with pain and attributes associated with majja or the nervous system also being present. It is important to note that these vatika prameha variants are considered incurable, making prevention and early intervention crucial in managing this condition according to Ayurvedic principles."
333,"Sweating, body odor, flabbiness of the body, liking for constantly lying on the bed, sitting, sleeping and leading an easy life, a feeling as if the cardiac region is covered with extraneous material, exudation of excreta from eyes, tongue and ears, corpulence of the body, excessive growth of hair and nails, liking for cold things, dryness of throat and palate, sweet taste in the mouth,  burning sensation in hands and legs and swarming of ants on the urine- these are the premonitory signs and symptoms of prameha. [13-14]","Prameha is a disease discussed in ancient Ayurvedic texts that is characterized by a collection of specific premonitory signs and symptoms. These can include excessive sweating, a strong body odor, and flabbiness of the body. Those suffering from prameha may also find themselves constantly seeking rest, whether through sleeping, sitting, or lying down. Other symptoms include a feeling of something being wrapped around the cardiac region, exudation from the eyes, tongue, and ears, and corpulence of the body. Additionally, individuals with prameha may notice excessive growth of hair and nails, a preference for cold things, dryness in the throat and palate, and a sweet taste in the mouth. Burning sensations in the hands and legs and swarms of ants around urine are also potential symptoms. Understanding and recognizing these premonitory signs can aid in early detection and treatment of prameha."
334,"Patients suffering from prameha are classified into two categories, viz. (1) those who are obese and strong, and (2) those who are emaciated and weak.   Patients belonging to the latter category should be given nourishing therapy. Patient of the former category who are strong and who have more doshas in the body should be treated with elimination therapy.  For this purpose, the oleated patient should be given various recipes described in Kalpa Sthana with a view to eliminating metabolic waste products through both upward and downward tracts. After the waste products (excess metabolic bi-products) are eliminated from his body, the patient should be given santarpana or nourishment therapy. ","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, patients with Prameha, a category of diseases that includes diabetes, are divided into two groups: the obese and strong, and the emaciated and weak. This differentiation is crucial in determining the appropriate treatment plan for each individual. Those who fall into the latter category, characterized by weakness and malnourishment, are prescribed nourishing therapy to restore their strength and vitality. On the other hand, patients who are obese and strong with an excess of bodily humors or doshas are treated with elimination therapy. This process involves using oleation techniques and recipes described in Kalpa Sthana to help eliminate metabolic waste products through both the upward and downward tracts of the body. Once these waste products have been expelled, the patient is then given santarpana or nourishment therapy to support their recovery and promote overall health and wellbeing."
335,"Because apatarpana (depletion) therapy in this condition may produce gulma, consumption, pain in phallus and urinary bladder including kidneys and retention of urine. Such patients should be given santarpana therapy depending upon their power of digestion. [15-17]","In the context of a certain medical condition, it is crucial to exercise caution while administering apatarpana (depletion) therapy due to its potential to induce gulma, digestive issues, discomfort in the urinary bladder and male reproductive organ, and urinary retention. Moreover, it can affect the kidneys. Therefore, it is highly recommended that such patients receive santarpana therapy instead, with careful consideration given to their digestive strength. This approach can help to mitigate the risks associated with depletion therapy and promote overall well-being in patients."
336,"If the patient of prameha is not eligible for samshodhana or elimination therapy, samshamana or alleviation therapies should be given. [18]  ","In cases where a patient with prameha, a type of diabetes mentioned in Ayurvedic texts, is not a suitable candidate for samshodhana or elimination therapies, samshamana or alleviation therapies become the next course of action. These palliative measures aim to mitigate the symptoms and manage the disease progression without undergoing the rigorous elimination processes. Samshamana therapies may include modifications in diet, lifestyle, and the use of pacifying herbs and medications to maintain a healthy balance of bodily functions and promote overall well-being."
337,"The patient suffering from prameha should be given the following food:  Manthas (flour of different types of corn mixed with water), kashayas (decoctions), barley powder, linctus prepared of barley and other light- eatables; Yavaudana (cooked barley) without adding any unctuous articles, vatya (barley porridge), saktu (roasted corn flour) and apupa (pancakes) mixed with the meat soup of gallinaceous and pecker birds and animals inhabiting arid land; Old shali rice cooked and mixed with the soup of mudga etc., and preparations of bitter vegetables; and Cooked shashtika rice and trina dhanyas mixed with the oil of danti, ingudi, atasi and sarshapa. Shashtika rice with shyamaka etc., truna dhanya with yava as predominant food is advised for prameha patients.   Various food recipes of yava with honey are indicated in kapha dominant prameha.  ","For individuals battling the ancient Indian disease known as Prameha, special dietary considerations are recommended to manage its symptoms better. The diet primarily consists of light eatables, such as Manthas, a mixture of various corn flours and water, and Kashayas, herbal decoctions. Barley and its derivatives, like barley powder, linctus, and Vatya, feature prominently in this diet. Yavaudana, a dish made of cooked barley without unctuous articles, and Saktu, roasted corn flour, are also included.

The consumption of Apupa, pancakes mixed with meat soups of gallinaceous and pecker birds and animals inhabiting arid lands, is advised. Moreover, Old Shali rice cooked and combined with mudga soup and preparations of bitter vegetables provide additional nutritional benefits. For Kapha-dominant Prameha, various recipes of Yava with honey are suggested. Shashtika rice with Shyamaka and Truna Dhanya with Yava as predominant foods is recommended for patients, offering a balanced and therapeutic approach to managing this ailment."
338,Barley soaked in the decoction of triphala and kept overnight should be mixed with honey. It is a refreshing (tarpana) diet. It should be taken by the patient suffering from prameha regularly to overcome the disease. ,"Experience the rejuvenating benefits of a traditional Tarpana diet, perfected to manage the symptoms of Prameha, a condition characterized by elevated sugar levels.

This wholesome concoction, when consumed regularly, offers a refreshing and natural approach to help regulate sugar levels, bringing balance to your body and promoting overall wellbeing. Immerse yourself in this ancient wisdom to experience a holistic approach to health and healing."
339,"Barley should be soaked separately with each of decoctions prescribed for the treatment of kaphaja prameha and taken by the patient in the form of saktu (roasted flour), apupa (pancake), dhana (roasted barley) and other types of eatables along with jaggery.  ","In the holistic approach of Ayurveda, barley plays a crucial role in the management of kaphaja prameha, a specific type of diabetes. The ancient Indian scriptures suggest that barley should be separately soaked with various decoctions prescribed for this condition and then consumed in the form of palatable dishes such as saktu, apupa, and dhana. These dishes, which also include roasted barley, are not only nutritious but also help in the management of this condition when taken along with jaggery. This practice not only caters to the dietary needs of the patient but also ensures that the medicinal properties of the decoctions are effectively absorbed and utilized by the body, thus aiding in the overall healing process."
340,"Various eatables prepared from the barley or bamboo seed or wheat previously eaten by asses, horses, cows, swans and deer and collected from their dung should be given to the patient suffering from prameha. [18-24]","The ancient practice of using dung-derived eatables as a form of medicine may seem unusual to many, but it forms a significant part of traditional healing systems in some cultures. For instance, in the treatment of prameha, a type of diabetes mentioned in Ayurveda, various dishes prepared from grains such as barley, bamboo seeds, and wheat that have previously been consumed and excreted by animals like asses, horses, cows, swans, and deer are believed to be beneficial. Practitioners claim that these foods, when collected and prepared properly, can help regulate the patient's metabolism and aid in managing the disease. However, it's crucial to note that such practices should only be carried out under the guidance of a trained professional due to their unconventional nature and potential health risks if not done correctly."
341,"Purificatory therapies including specifically emesis and fasting therapies, administered at the appropriate time, cure kaphaja types of prameha. Similarly, pittaja types of prameha are overcome by purgation, santarpana (refreshing therapy) and alleviation therapies. [25]","Purificatory therapies have been a cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine for centuries, with specific treatments targeted at different dosha types to heal various ailments. For instance, kaphaja types of prameha, a group of diseases that affect the urinary system, can be cured through timely administrations of emesis and fasting therapies. On the other hand, pittaja types of prameha, which are caused by an imbalance in the fire element of the body, can be overcome through purgation, refreshing therapy, and alleviation treatments. These personalized approaches to healing have been practiced for thousands of years and continue to be a vital part of Ayurvedic medicine today."
342,"The patient suffering from prameha should take the decoction of darvi, surahva, triphala and musta mixed with honey. He may also take haridra along with the juice of amalaki. [26]","For those battling the debilitating effects of prameha, a specialized approach to diet and herbal remedies is crucial for effective management. According to Ayurvedic traditions, a carefully curated decoction of darvi, surahva, triphla, and musta mixed with soothing honey can provide much-needed relief for patients. Additionally, incorporating haridra and the juice of amalaki into one's dietary regimen can further support the body in combating this challenging condition.

Its efficacy is said to be so profound that it can even alleviate diabetes in its most acute forms. This concoction, steeped in ancient wisdom, offers a natural and holistic approach to managing diabetes, providing a viable alternative to conventional medical interventions for those inclined towards traditional remedies."
351,"Lodhra, shati, pushkaramula, ela, murva, vidanga, triphala, yamani, chavya, priyangu, kramuka, vishala, kiratatikta, katurohini, bharngi, nata, chitraka, pippalimula, kushtha, ativisha, patha, kalingaka, keshara, indravaruni, nakha, patra, maricha and plava- one karsha of each of these drugs should be boiled in one drona of water till one fourth remains. This decoction along with half its quantity of honey should be kept inside a ghee smeared jar for a fort night. This is called madhvasava. ","The ancient practice of Ayurvedic medicine has long promoted the use of various herbal remedies for a variety of ailments. One such concoction, known as Madhvasava, is created through a meticulous process involving a specific selection of herbs. A karsha of lodhra, shati, pushkaramula, ela, murva, vidanga, triphala, yamani, chavya, priyangu, kramuka, vishala, kiratatikta, katurohini, bharngi, nata, chitraka, pippalimula, kushtha, ativisha, patha, kalingaka, keshara, indravaruni, nakha, patra, maricha, and plava are carefully measured and combined. These ingredients are then boiled in a single drona of water until only a quarter remains. The resulting decoction is then mixed with an equal amount of honey and stored in a jar coated with ghee for a fortnight. The final product, Madhvasava, is believed to offer medicinal benefits and is used in Ayurvedic practices to this day."
352,"It instantaneously cures kaphaja and paittika types of meha when administered in a dose of two palas. It also cures pandu, arsha, aruchi, grahani dosha, kilasa and different types of kushtha.[41-44]","The miraculous properties of this ancient remedy are truly laudable, capable of instantly curing kaphaja and paittika types of meha (a urinary disorder) when administered in a dose of two palas. Furthermore, it is known to cure pandu (anemia), arsha (hemorrhoids), aruchi (loss of appetite), grahani dosha (digestive disorders), kilasa (skin disease), and various types of kushtha (dermatological disorders). This powerful concoction has been a beacon of hope for many, providing relief and respite from a wide range of health afflictions, and continues to be celebrated for its remarkable healing abilities even today."
353,"In the above mentioned decoction, eight palas of danti, eight palas of sugar and the same quantity of honey should be added and processed. Similarly, in the above mentioned decoction four palas of bhallataka, eight palas of sugar and the same quantity of honey should be added and processed. These two asavas (namely dantyasava and bhallatokusava) are useful in the treatment of prameha. [45]","The ancient decoction, when prepared with eight palas each of danti, sugar, and honey, along with four palas of bhallataka, eight palas of sugar, and an equal amount of honey, creates two unique fermented medicines known as Dantyasava and Bhallatakusava. These powerful formulations have been traditionally used in the treatment of prameha, a broad term in Ayurveda that encompasses various urinary and metabolic disorders, similar to modern-day diabetes. The combination of these ingredients in a carefully prepared decoction harnesses their potential to support balanced metabolism and overall health."
354,"The patient suffering from prameha should drink sarodaka (water boiled with the heart- wood of khadira etc.,), kushodaka (water boiled with kusha), madhudaka (water mixed with honey), triphala rasa (juice or decoction of triphala) or sidhu (a type of wine) which is properly fermented or madhvika (another type of wine) which is of superior quality and is prepared after fermenting for a long time.  ","In managing the condition of prameha, Ayurvedic practices offer several options for hydration that extend beyond plain water. These alternatives include sarodaka, water that has been boiled with the heart-wood of khadira; kushodaka, prepared by boiling kusha grass; madhudaka, a concoction of water and honey; and triphala rasa, a juice or decoction made from triphala. Additionally, properly fermented sidhu or madhvika, a wine that has been fermented for an extended period, is also recommended. Each of these options is believed to offer specific therapeutic benefits that can contribute to managing this condition effectively."
355,"Spit- roasted meat of animals and birds and different eatables prepared of barley should be given to the patient to eat. Different types of prameha caused by over-nourishment should be alleviated by the administration of elimination therapies, arishtas (a type of wine), decoctions and various types of linctus.  ","In the care and treatment of certain medical conditions, particularly those related to ailments caused by over-nutrition, ancient medical wisdom offers some interesting recommendations. For instance, those suffering from diseases caused by excessive consumption of rich foods might benefit from a diet of spit-roasted meats and bird dishes, along with various barley-based meals. Similarly, for types of prameha, a group of diseases characterized by symptoms such as excessive thirst, urination, and sugar cravings, Ayurvedic practitioners suggest elimination therapies, along with the consumption of specially prepared arishtas, decoctions, and linctuses. These traditional remedials, while requiring further scientific exploration, offer a unique and potentially valuable perspective on diet and healing."
356,"Persons habitually taking roasted barley, dry corn- flour, mudga and amalaka do not suffer from prameha, shvitra (leucoderma), mutrakrucchra (dysuria) and kaphaja kushtha. [46-48]","In the context of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, it is believed that certain dietary habits can play a significant role in preventing specific ailments. According to Sushruta Samhita, a revered Ayurvedic text, consuming roasted barley, dry cornflour, mudga (a type of bean), and amalaka (Indian gooseberry) regularly can contribute to improved health and reduced susceptibility to prameha (a group of urinary disorders), shvitra (leucoderma), mutrakrucchra (dysuria), and kaphaja kushtha (a type of skin disease). These natural remedies have been used for centuries to maintain balance in the body and prevent diseases, emphasizing the importance of a balanced and wholesome diet in Ayurvedic philosophy."
357,Effective formulations for producing drying effect on obese patients while describing the management of diseases caused by over- nourishment are useful in the treatment of pramehas caused by kapha and pitta dominance. [49],"The management of pramehas, a group of diseases caused by imbalanced nutrition in Ayurvedic medicine, can greatly benefit from effective formulations that address kapha and pitta dominance while producing a drying effect on obese patients. These targeted remedies can help mitigate the complications and symptoms associated with excess weight, ultimately contributing to a more holistic and balanced approach to treating pramehas and improving overall health. Further exploration and development of these formulations could lead to significant advancements in the treatment and prevention of obesity-related ailments in Ayurvedic practice."
358,"Pramehas get immediately cured by different types of exercises, unction, bath, sprinkling of water over the body and application of ointment made of sevya (ushira), tvak, ela, aguru, chandana etc. [50]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, prameha, a group of diseases characterized by excessive urination and related symptoms, can be effectively treated through a variety of physical interventions. These may include specific exercise routines designed to target and heal the affected areas. Additionally, certain unctions and medicated baths may be prescribed to provide relief and promote overall wellness. Furthermore, the therapeutic application of specially formulated ointments made from a combination of potent herbs such as sevya (ushira), tvak, ela, aguru, and chandana can play a crucial role in alleviating the symptoms of prameha and facilitating a swift and comprehensive recovery. Through this holistic and individualized approach to treatment, those suffering from prameha can find solace and healing in the time-tested wisdom of Ayurveda."
359,"Aggravated kleda (liquid element of the body), medas (adipose tissue) and kapha are responsible for the causation of prameha. Keeping this in view, the physician, in the beginning, should administer depletion therapies to patients suffering with  kapha and pitta dominant types of prameha. [51]","Prameha, a significant category in Ayurvedic medicine, is believed to be caused by an imbalance in the bodily liquids known as kleda, adipose tissue or medas, and the humors kapha and pitta. When these elements become aggravated, they can lead to the manifestation of prameha. As a preventive measure, it is advised that patients with a dominant kapha and pitta presentation should initially undergo depletion therapies, as recommended by their physician. These treatments aim to restore balance to the body and alleviate the symptoms associated with prameha."
360,"Formulations described earlier for the vatika prameha are actually meant for vata dominant prameha where vata is secondarily (subsequently) aggravated. If the vata is primarily aggravated in prameha because of excessive depletion of tissue elements, then it is incurable and the physician need not make efforts to treat. [52]","The formulations traditionally used for managing Vatika Prameha, a type of urinary disorder in Ayurveda, are specifically designed to address cases where Vata is secondarily aggravated. However, if Vata is primarily aggravated due to excessive depletion of tissue elements, the condition is considered incurable. In such situations, it is believed that further efforts to treat the condition may not yield favorable results, and it may be more prudent to focus on managing the symptoms and preventing any further complications. This highlights the importance of accurately identifying the root cause of the disorder and customizing treatment plans accordingly to ensure optimal outcomes in Ayurvedic medicine."
361,Etiological factors responsible for the causation of different types of prameha should be avoided even after prameha are manifested. The causative factors described  shall be avoided during the treatment of those particular diseases (even after its manifestation). [53],"The etiological factors that cause various forms of prameha, a group of diseases in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, should be strictly avoided, even after the symptoms have manifested. These causative factors, if not controlled, can exacerbate the condition and hinder the recovery process during treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to not only focus on treating the disease but also on preventing its recurrence or worsening by avoiding these etiological factors. By adopting this holistic approach, individuals can better manage their health and improve their overall quality of life."
362,"If the color of the urine is yellow or if blood is excreted through the urine without the prior manifestation of premonitory signs and symptoms of prameha, such a person should not be diagnosed as a patient of prameha. He should be diagnosed as a case of rakta-pitta (a disease characterized by bleeding from different parts of body).[54]","The color of a person's urine can provide valuable insights into their health, and in some cases, it can even help in making a diagnosis. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, if a person's urine is consistently yellow or if there is evidence of blood in their urine, it should not be interpreted as a symptom of prameha (a group of diseases characterized by improper metabolism of fluids and sugar). Instead, such a person should be diagnosed with rakta-pitta, a disease that is characterized by bleeding from different parts of the body. It is essential to accurately distinguish between these two conditions to provide appropriate treatment and care to patients, highlighting the importance of careful observation and interpretation of bodily symptoms in diagnosing diseases."
363,"If the patient suffering from prameha passes urine which is sweet, slimy and honey-like, then there are two possibilities. It is caused either by the diminution of doshas having vata-dominant type or by over- nourishment having kapha dominant type. [55]","The nature of urine can provide valuable insights into a patient's health, particularly for those suffering from prameha, a traditional Ayurvedic term for diabetes. If a patient's urine is observed to be sweet, slimy, and resembling honey in texture, this could indicate one of two possibilities. Either the diminution of vata-dominant doshas or the excess of kapha-dominant over-nourishment could be at play. Understanding these nuances can significantly aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition, highlighting the importance of detailed observation in Ayurvedic practice."
364,"Kapha dominant and pitta dominant types of prameha, if preceded by their premonitory signs and symptoms, are incurable. Similarly, vatika prameha, where vata is aggravated right from the beginning is incurable. Pitta dominant types of prameha are generally palliable. But they are curable if medas (adipose tissue) is not vitiated. [56]","Prameha, a group of urinary disorders in Ayurvedic medicine, can be difficult to treat depending on the dominant dosha involved. For those with Kapha or Pitta dominant Prameha, early detection and treatment of premonitory signs and symptoms can make a significant difference in prognosis. However, once Vata becomes aggravated in Vatika Prameha, the condition is considered incurable. On a positive note, Pitta dominant Prameha can be curable if the adipose tissue remains untouched, and proper medical intervention is sought in a timely manner. Effective management and regular monitoring can help mitigate the severity of these conditions, allowing individuals to lead healthier lives."
365,"Patients who suffer from prameha since birth (congenital) and those who are borne of prameha parents (hereditary) are not curable because of the morbidity in their bija (genes). Similarly, other hereditary (kulaja/familial) ailments are considered as incurable. [57]","The fundamental basis of certain medical conditions, such as congenital prameha and other kulaja ailments, can be traced back to the morbidity in a patient's genes or inherited from prameha parents. This inherent genetic predisposition renders these conditions incurable, making it challenging to eradicate these ailments completely, despite medical advancements. The focus then shifts towards managing symptoms, improving quality of life, and halting the progression of these hereditary diseases."
366,"Seven types of prameha pidaka of patients suffering from prameha described in the quadrate on diseases (rogadhikara) are to be treated by expert surgeons with the help of shastras (surgical operations), samshodhana (cleansing) and ropana (healing therapies). [58]","In the comprehensive treatise on diseases, referred to as the quadrate, the section on Prameha, a category of ailments, outlines seven distinct kinds of Prameha Pidaka that afflict patients. The text suggests that these complex conditions should be addressed by skilled surgeons who are well-versed in the application of surgical operations, cleansing techniques, and healing therapies. This holistic approach, grounded in ancient medical wisdom, underscores the significance of integrating both surgical and therapeutic interventions to treat and manage these intricate medical disorders."
367,"Here are the recapulatory verses:   The causes, dosha, dushya, curability, characteristics of urine in prameha, two types of patients, three modes of treatment, disadvantages of excess depletion therapy, various food items of yava, mantha, various decoctions used in treatment of prameha, medicated oils, ghee preparations, linctuses, diet articles, fermented preparations like asava, various exercises, baths, massage, fragrant applications all these are described in the management of prameha. [59-61]    Thus, ends the sixth chapter dealing with the treatment of prameha of Chikitsa Sthana of Agnivesha’s work as redacted by Charak.[6]","In this discussion, we have explored the detailed management of prameha, a group of urinary disorders, as described in Charak's Chikitsa Sthana. The chapter outlines various factors such as the causative factors (dosha) and the affected bodily tissues (dushya). The curability and characteristics of urine in prameha have also been elaborated, providing valuable insights into diagnosing and assessing the condition's severity. Two types of patients and three modes of treatment have been explained, including depletion therapy and its potential downsides when used excessively. The text also highlights various food items and medicinal preparations like decoctions, medicated oils, ghee preparations, linctuses, and fermented beverages (asava). Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of diet, exercise, baths, massage, and fragrant applications in the management of prameha. Overall, this comprehensive review offers a holistic approach to understanding and treating prameha, rooted in the ancient wisdom of Ayurvedic medicine."
368,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Grahani Chikitsa"" (Management of diseases of digestion and metabolism). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","Diving into the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, Lord Atreya's teachings focus on the chapter of ""Grahani Chikitsa,"" which deals with the critical area of digestion and metabolism in the human body. This branch of study is essential for understanding how our body processes food, assimilates nutrients, and eliminates waste materials. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will uncover the various ailments, treatments, and dietary recommendations associated with this system, shedding light on how ancient wisdom can contribute to modern-day health and wellness practices."
369,"Dehagni (all the entities in the body that are responsible for digestion and metabolism) is the fundamental causative agent for longevity, normal complexion, normal strength, good health, motivation, normal growth, normal luster, normal ojas, normal body temperature and various other forms of agni. Even the existence of an individual is said to be because of dehagni. [3]","Dehagni, the collection of all digestive and metabolic functions within the body, is widely regarded as the fundamental causative agent for longevity, vitality, and overall health. A strong dehagni not only ensures normal complexion, strength, and motivation but also promotes normal growth, luster, ojas, and body temperature. Moreover, it is believed that the very existence of an individual depends on a healthy and balanced dehagni. This vital force plays a crucial role in maintaining various other forms of agni, further emphasizing its significance in Ayurvedic philosophy and overall well-being."
370,"When the agni stops functioning, the individual dies; if the agni functions normally, the individual can lead a healthy and long life. Similarly, if the agni becomes abnormal, the individual suffers from various diseases; and hence, the agni is said to be the root cause of health and longevity [4]","The concept of ""agni,"" or digestive fire, holds immense significance in many philosophical and health systems, such as Ayurveda. A key indicator of overall health, agni is responsible for digesting food and transforming it into energy. If this vital function ceases, it is believed that an individual's life will end. Conversely, when agni operates optimally, it enables individuals to maintain a balanced lifestyle and increases their chances of living a long, healthy life. However, should agni become impaired or abnormal, various health issues may arise, solidifying the belief that agni is indeed the foundation of health and longevity."
371,"The food one consumes becomes capable of nourishing the body tissues and of promoting the ojas (vital essence), strength, complexion etc., only in the presence of normally functioning agni. In the absence of normal digestion (and metabolism), the normal body tissues such as rasa cannot be formed nor nourished [5]","The role of agni, or digestive fire, in the assimilation of food is crucial for the overall health and well-being of the body. According to Ayurvedic texts, it is only when agni is functioning optimally that the food consumed can be properly broken down, nutrients absorbed, and the vital essence or ojas strengthened. In the absence of normal digestion and metabolism, the body's tissues, such as rasa (plasma), cannot be formed or nourished, leading to weakened strength, complexion, and overall health. Therefore, maintaining a healthy agni is essential for the body to reap the full benefits of the nutrients in the food we consume."
372,"The ingested food is carried to koshtha by prana vata. The food disintegrates because of the liquids, and further it becomes soft because of the fatty substances. The samana vata, that has an inherent ability to intensify the agni, intensifies the digestive enzymes and properly digests the food that one consumes timely and in an appropriate quantity, thus leading to longevity. This process of digestion by agni in the gut which leads to the formation of rasa and mala is comparable to the process of cooking of the raw rice kept in an earthen vessel containing water on a fire [6-8]","The journey of food within the human body, as per Ayurvedic principles, involves the carriage of ingested food to the koshtha by prana vata, where it breaks down due to the presence of liquids and softens because of fatty substances. This softer mass is then subjected to the powerful agni or digestive enzymes, which get intensified by samana vata, leading to the digestion of food that is timely and appropriate in quantity. This process of digestion, which results in the formation of rasa and mala, can be compared to the cooking of raw rice in an earthen vessel containing water, placed on a fire, where the heat and water break down and soften the rice grains, making them easier to digest and utilize for energy and nourishment, ultimately contributing to longevity."
373,"As soon as the food that has all the six tastes is consumed, it undergoes the first stage of digestion known as madhura (sweet) state during which kapha is produced which is like froth. ","The culinary experience that incorporates all six tastes holds a significant role in the ancient Indian practice of Ayurveda. According to this wisdom, once the diverse flavors - sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent - come together in a meal, the first stage of digestion begins, classified as the 'madhura' (sweet) state. This initial process is characterized by the generation of kapha, a bodily humor akin to froth. Kapha's emergence during this stage establishes a balanced beginning for the body's intricate and vital process of absorbing nutrients and converting them into energy."
374,"Afterwards, while the food undergoing digestion is in its partially digested form, it attains amla (sour) state.   When the semi-digested food leaves the stomach, the release of liquid form of pitta known as accha-pitta occurs.  ","After the process of digestion begins, the food takes on a sour taste, known as 'amla' in Ayurvedic medicine. This sour flavor is indicative of the food's partially digested state, which occurs in the stomach. Once the semi-digested food leaves the stomach, it triggers the release of a liquid form of pitta called 'accha-pitta.' This substance is essential for maintaining a healthy digestive process and is a key component in the overall balance of the body's doshas. Understanding the role that accha-pitta plays in digestion can help individuals make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle choices."
375,"When the pakva part (the non-absorbable remnant part after the absorption of the nutrients), reaches the pakvashaya (the colon), the drying effect of agni converts it into a solid mass. There also occurs the release of vata which is katu (pungent) state [9-11]","In the digestive process described in this context, the pakva part, or the remaining undigested food, moves into the pakvashaya, or colon. Once there, the drying effect of agni, or digestive fire, transforms this pakva part into a solid mass. Coinciding with this transformation is the release of vata, which assumes a katu, or pungent, state. This stage of the process highlights the complex and interconnected nature of digestion in this system, with various factors influencing and building upon one another."
376,"The food that possesses pleasant smell (taste, appearance, consistency,) etc., nourishes the similar entities in the body such as the sensory organs of smell by gandha etc (e.g. taste, vision, touch etc senses by respective mahabhuta) [12]","In the realm of gastronomy, food that is not only delicious but also aesthetically pleasing to the eye can have a significant impact on our overall dining experience. The fragrant aroma of a meal can stimulate our olfactory senses, awakening our sense of smell and enhancing our appetite. Similarly, the taste, appearance, and texture of food can satisfy our sense of taste and touch, while the visual appeal of a dish can delight our sense of sight. In this way, the various properties of food can nurture and gratify our corresponding senses, creating a harmonious and enjoyable dining experience that engages all five senses. According to Ayurvedic principles, each sense is associated with a specific element or mahabhuta - such as taste with water, vision with fire, touch with air, and smell with earth - and so the sensory delights of a meal can have a profound impact on our physical and emotional wellbeing. By savoring and appreciating the many sensory aspects of a meal, we can truly nourish our minds, bodies, and spirits."
377,"There are five types of agni namely, bhauma, apya, agneya, vayavya and nabhasa. These five bhutagni are one of each mahabhuta transform/metabolize those components of the food that are homologous to them in their composition of structure of human organism. (such as parthiva, apya etc) [13]","The concept of Agni in Ayurveda is a fascinating one, with five distinct types playing crucial roles in the human body. Known as Bhauma, Apya, Agneya, Vayavya, and Nabhasa, these Agnis are responsible for transforming and metabolizing the components of food that share a similar structure or composition with each respective Mahabhuta. For instance, the Agni named Parthiva metabolizes food elements that have an affinity with the Earth element. Delving deeper into each Agni's function can offer valuable insights into maintaining balance and wellness in the body."
378,Specific categories of entities in the body having specific attributes can be nourished by only those substances that belong to the same category having those same attributes. This means that parthiva entities in the body (one that is dominated by prithvi mahabhuta in its composition) can be nourished only by the parthiva substances in the food and so on. The same rule applies to the whole body [14],"The principles of Ayurvedic medicine outline specific requirements for the nourishment of certain bodily entities. Entities dominated by the prithvi mahabhuta are classified as parthiva and have unique attributes. To maintain their health and promote optimal functioning, it is essential to consume foods containing substances that share these same attributes. This concept extends to the whole body, emphasizing the importance of consuming a balanced diet that aligns with one's individual needs and makeup. By following this approach, individuals can support their overall health and well-being, according to Ayurvedic principles. (Word count: 114)

379,"Further, the seven components that sustain the body, known as dhatu (tissues), are metabolized/transformed into two kinds of products known as sara (nutrition) and kitta (waste). This process is the function of seven specific entities known as dhatvagni; each dhatvagni is specific for its corresponding dhatu [15]","The human body's sustenance relies on seven key components, or dhatus, that are metabolized to create two types of products: nutritious sara and waste kitta. This complex process is facilitated by seven distinct entities, known as dhatvagni, with each dhatvagni responsible for transforming its corresponding dhatu. As mentioned in [15], this system plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and well-being of an individual, making it essential to understand the functions and importance of each component in this intricate network."
380,Rakta is produced after rasa and then mamsa. After mamsa the medas is formed and then asthi is produced. After asthi the majja is derived and then shukra is produced and finally fine shukra leads to garbha [16],"In the process of creation, as outlined in various ancient texts, Rakta is produced after Rasa, marking an important stage in the formation of living beings. Following the creation of Raka, Mamsa, or muscle tissue, comes into existence. The development of Medas, or fatty tissue, occurs next, paving the way for the formation of Asthi, or bone tissue. Once Asthi is formed, Majja, or marrow, is derived, setting the stage for the creation of Shukra, or reproductive tissue. The finest form of Shukra ultimately leads to the formation of Garbha, or the creation of new life, thus completing this complex and fascinating process."
381,Stanya (breast milk) and the menstrual blood are derived after rasa. Kandara (tendon) and sira(vein) are derived after rakta. Vasa(muscle fat) and the six layers of tvacha (skin) are derived after mamsa (muscle) and snayu(ligament) are derived after medas (adipose tissue) [17],"The process of creation, as described in ancient texts, involves a series of derivations from one original source. For instance, stanya, or breast milk, and menstrual blood are said to be formed from rasa, the primary source. Similarly, kandara, or tendon, and sira, or vein, are formed from rakta, which is derived from rasa. Further derivations include vasa, or muscle fat, and the six layers of tvacha, or skin, which are formed from mamsa, or muscle, and snayu, or ligament, which in turn are derived from medas, or adipose tissue. This fascinating perspective on human development offers a unique window into ancient medical and philosophical thought."
382,"The feces and the urine are the kitta (non-nutrient portion/waste portion/byproduct) of ingested food. The kitta of rasa is mala-kapha (excretions). Mala-pitta (bile pigment) is the kitta of rakta. Kha-mala (the wastes accumulated in the hollow structures of the body such as external ears and nostrils) are the kitta of mamsa. Sweda (sweat) is the mala of medas. Kesha (hairs on the head) and loma (body hair) are the mala of asthi. The mala of majja is the oily excretion of the eye and the skin (sebum). Thus, the dhatus continuously undergo two kinds of transformation: prasada (nutrient portion) and kitta (non-nutrient portion). This entire sequence of transformation and metabolism of dhatu is thus inter dependent [18-19½]","In the Ayurvedic tradition, the human body is understood to constantly undergo a process of transformation, where the various tissues or dhatus metabolize food into nutrients and waste products. According to this system, feces and urine represent the waste products or kitta of ingested food, while mala-kapha is the excretion that comes from rasa, or nutritional plasma. Similarly, mala-pitta is the waste product that is generated from rakta, or blood, and kha-mala is the accumulated waste in hollow structures such as external ears and nostrils, which comes from mamsa or muscle tissue. Sweda, or sweat, is the excretion that comes from medas or fat tissue, while kesha and loma, or hairs on the head and body hair, represent the waste products of asthi or bone tissue. Finally, the oily excretion from the eyes and skin is considered to be the waste product or mala of majja, or nerve tissue. This interconnected process of transformation and metabolism highlights the deep interdependence of all bodily functions in Ayurvedic medicine."
383,Vrishya substance (the substance that promotes sexual vigor) nourishes the shukra immediately due to its specific influential effect (prabhava) [20],"The mysterious power of the Vrishya substance has long been celebrated in ancient texts for its immediate impact on sexual vitality. This potent agent is known to nourish and strengthen the shukra, or reproductive tissue, in a remarkable way. The specific prabhava, or influential effect, of this substance sets it apart from other remedies, allowing it to directly target and enhance the male reproductive system. This unique characteristic makes the Vrishya substance a highly valued resource in Ayurvedic medicine, where it is often used to promote overall vitality and virility."
384,"Some scholars believe that the conversion of rasa up to shukra occurs in a span of six days and six nights. This process of transformation of nourishing portion of the digested food is continuous similar to rotating wheel [21]  Note: Adulterated Verses:  Verses from 22 to 35 are available in the text in bracket and Chakrapani has also not offered the commentary on these verses, hence these verses are considered as adulterated.","In the ancient science of Ayurveda, there is a belief among some scholars that the transformation of rasa into shukra, the nutritive fluid, takes place over a period of six days and six nights. This process, which is likened to a continuously rotating wheel, is said to convert the nourishing portion of digested food into more subtle forms, eventually resulting in the creation of reproductive tissue. However, it is worth noting that there is a section of text, comprising verses 22 to 35, which is considered adulterated and does not contain any commentary from Chakrapani, one of the most authoritative commentators on this subject."
385,"(After listening to the above explanation by his teacher, the student asked the following doubt:  How is it that rakta is formed in the body out of rasa, though being different from it? Rasa is in fact colorless, and how does it attain the red color of rakta? How is it that a solid structure such as mamsa is formed out of rakta which is a fluid by its nature? How is it that, again, from the mamsa, which is solid, a fluid substance such as meda is formed?   How is it that a rough asthi is formed out of smooth structures such as mamsa and meda? How does the soft and fatty majja form out of rough structures such as asthi? If at all shukra, which is present everywhere in the body is formed out of majja that is located inside the asthi, how does it come out as one cannot see pores on asthi? [22-26]","In an attempt to understand the complex process of bodily functions, the inquisitive student questioned the transformation of bodily substances. He inquired about the formation of rakta (blood) from rasa (plasma), which, despite being different, arises from it, and how the colorless rasa turns red. He further pondered over the formation of solid mamsa (muscles) from fluid rakta and then the creation of another fluid substance, meda (fat), from solid mamsa. The student also wondered about the creation of rough asthi (bones) from smooth mamsa and meda and how the soft and fatty majja (marrow) emerges from the rough asthi. Lastly, he questioned how shukra (semen), which is present throughout the body, forms from majja located inside the asthi and how it manages to come out, since asthi does not have any visible pores."
386,"After listening to the query raised by the student, the teacher replied as follows:  The nourishment fluid formed, known as rasa, undergoes transformation by the ushma (heat) of pitta and gets converted into the red colored tissue known as rakta [27-28]","In a discussion that centered around the intricacies of the human body, a student's question prompted a detailed response from the teacher. The educator began by discussing the formation of rasa, a nourishment fluid that plays a vital role in the body's overall health. This fluid, the teacher explained, undergoes a transformation process brought about by the heat of pitta, leading to the creation of rakta, a red-colored tissue that is crucial for proper bodily function. This fascinating explanation sheds light on the complex systems at work within the human body, leaving the student with a deeper appreciation for the intricate processes that occur within us every day (27-28)."
387,"Due to the action of heat along with the vata, ambu (water) and tejas, the rakta is converted into stable mamsa, after being acted upon by its own agni (mamsadhatvagni) [29]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the transformation of rakta (blood) into mamsa (muscle tissue) is a fascinating process that involves the action of heat and various bodily elements. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, this conversion is facilitated by the combined action of vata, ambu (water), and tejas, while being simultaneously broken down by its own agni or mamsadhatvagni. This intricate process highlights the interconnectedness of different bodily systems and the crucial role that internal heat plays in maintaining proper balance and function within the body."
388,"Because of the action of medo-dhatvagni on the excessively dominant snigdha attribute of aṃbu, the meda dhatu is formed [29½]","The process of formation of meda dhatu, or adipose tissue, is closely connected to the balance of doshas and dhatus in the body, according to Ayurveda. When medo-dhatvagni, the fire element responsible for the metabolism of fat, acts upon the overly dominant snigdha attribute (or unctuousness) of aham (or plasma), it leads to the formation of meda dhatu. This process is crucial for maintaining the health and balance of the body, showcasing the interconnectedness and complexity of Ayurvedic physiology."
389,"Because of the action of asthi dhātvagni on the aggregation of prithvi, agni and anila, roughness is attained during the formation of the asthi [30]","The formation of asthi, or bone tissue, is a complex process that involves the action of various elements and forces. According to Ayurvedic traditions, the roughness that is characteristic of bone tissue is attained during this process due to the action of asthi dhātvagni, a type of bodily fire, on an aggregation of prithvi, agni, and anila. Prithvi represents the earth element and provides stability, while agni represents the fire element and contributes to the transformative processes that occur during bone formation. Anila, or air, is responsible for providing lightness and movement. The interaction of these elements under the influence of asthi dhātvagni creates a rough texture, making the bone tissue strong and resilient."
390,"Vata produces hollowness inside the asthi dhatu, and after which, these hollow cavities get filled up by fatty tissue which is known as majja [31]","The concept of Vata and asthi dhatu is a fundamental principle in Ayurvedic medicine. According to this ancient practice, Vata is responsible for creating hollowness within the asthi dhatu or bone tissue. This empty space then gets filled up with another tissue called majja, which is a fatty substance. This transformation is a crucial aspect of maintaining balance and health in the body, according to Ayurvedic beliefs. Understanding this process can provide valuable insights into overall health and wellness."
391,"The sneha (fatty) portion of majja produces shukra. The porosity in the asthi is produced because of the factors such as vata and akasha. Shukra comes out of asthi through these pores just as the water comes out of a new earthen vessel. Through the channels known as shukravaha srotamsi, this shukra spreads all over the body. This shukra is discharged through the urethra (which is connected to the urinary bladder) because of several factors such as sexual excitation, reflex activities (vega), and mental determination (samkalpa). Just as the ghee moves out with ease when heated, the shukra too, is discharged due to the heat liberated during the sexual activity. This process of seminal discharge is comparable with the movement of water from a place of lower altitude to a place of higher altitude) [32-35]","The substance known as ""sneha"" or fat in the tissue of ""majja"" plays a crucial role in the creation of ""shukra,"" which is considered a vital fluid for human body. This ""shukra"" is produced with the help of ""vata"" and ""akasha"" factors that create porosity in the ""asthi"" or bones. Once produced, ""shukra"" finds its way out through these pores, similar to water seeping out of a new earthen pot. It then spreads throughout the body through specific channels named ""shukravaha srotamsi."" Eventually, ""shukra"" is discharged through the urethra, which is connected to the urinary bladder, due to various factors such as sexual excitement, reflex activities, and mental determination. This release can be compared to water flowing from a lower to a higher altitude, and it's facilitated by the heat generated during sexual activity, similar to how ghee moves when heated."
392,"Because of being forcefully propelled (out of the heart) by the action of vyana vata, the rasa dhatu spreads all over the body simultaneously, continuously and for the entire life [36]","The vital essence of nutrition, rasa dhatu, is disseminated throughout the body, ensuring its nourishment and sustenance. This distribution is made possible by the forceful impulsion of vyana vata, a type of bodily wind. From the heart, it is expelled and moves in all directions, continuously and ceaselessly supplying nourishment for the entirety of one's life. This constant flow is a fundamental aspect of our bodily function and is essential for maintaining health and balance within."
393,"Wherever the rasa experiences obstacle due to abnormality in srotas, rasa readily produces disease in that very same location. This process is comparable with that of the clouds producing rainfall in a localized region that is favorable for rainfall [37]","The concept of health and wellness in Ayurveda is closely tied to the balance and flow of rasa, or nutrient fluid, within the body. When there is an obstruction in the srotas, or channels, that transport rasa, it can lead to the accumulation of this fluid and the subsequent production of disease in the affected area. This process is akin to the way clouds release rainfall in areas that are particularly conducive to it. Just as rainfall nourishes the earth and promotes growth, rasa nourishes the body's tissues and supports overall health. However, when there is a blockage in the srotas, rasa is unable to reach its intended destination and instead accumulates, leading to the development of illness. By understanding this connection between rasa and the srotas, practitioners of Ayurveda can better identify and address imbalances in the body and promote optimal health and well-being."
394,"This principle is applicable even in case of dosha, where ekadesha prakopa (abnormal increase at a local site) occurs [37½]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the principle of visamsaavabhaava (the effect of dissimilarity) also extends to the phenomenon of ekadesha prakopa in dosha. Doshas, or bodily humors, can become abnormally increased at localized sites, leading to an imbalance that can manifest as disease. This concept highlights the importance of addressing not only general imbalances but also localized increases in dosha to restore health and maintain equilibrium within the body. Therefore, it is crucial to consider this principle when evaluating and treating health conditions according to Ayurvedic traditions."
395,"Thus ends the description of the physiological functions of bhutagni, dhatvagni and jatharagni [38]","In summary, we have explored the roles and responsibilities of three essential components in the human body as per Ayurvedic principles: bhutagni, dhatvagni, and jatharagni. These agnis, or fires, play a crucial part in various physiological functions, from breaking down food to transforming it into nutrients, to maintaining the balance and health of the body's tissues. Understanding their roles is essential to gaining a holistic view of how the body functions and how to maintain optimal health through Ayurvedic practices. With this, we conclude our examination of these fascinating components and their significance in Ayurvedic medicine."
396,Jatharagni is known as the King among all the forms of agni. The intensification and diminution of all other forms of agni is in fact dependent on jatharagni [39],"Jatharagni, often referred to as the ""King of Agnis,"" holds a prominent position in the hierarchy of physiological fire elements in the human body. All other forms of agni are dependent on the intensity and regulation that jatharagni provides. This vital digestive fire, when balanced, ensures proper digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, leading to optimal health. Conversely, imbalanced jatharagni can disrupt these functions, potentially causing digestive disorders and overall health deterioration. Thus, understanding and maintaining jatharagni's equilibrium is crucial for well-being, according to Ayurvedic wisdom."
397,"An individual should take utmost care to maintain the agni by providing fuel in the form of food and drinks which should be taken as per the rules mentioned, because life and strength of an individual depends on agni [40]","The concept of ""agni"" is a crucial principle in many philosophies and health practices, believed to govern the internal fire responsible for digestion, metabolism, and overall strength within an individual. To maintain this vital force, it is essential to pay meticulous attention to one's dietary choices. Consuming food and drinks that align with the specified rules can significantly contribute to the well-being and longevity of an individual. The harmony of one's agni is closely linked to the balance of life forces, making it a priority to nourish this inner fire with appropriate fuel, ultimately sustaining both life and strength."
398,"If an individual indulges in food without following the rules and regulation of diet intake, then he quickly suffers from diseases caused by the vitiation of grahani because of his greedy habits. Such diseases are being described henceforth [41]","The importance of adhering to dietary guidelines cannot be overstated. Indulging in food without consideration for portion control and balanced nutrition can quickly lead to health complications. This is especially true for the stomach and digestive system, where excessive eating can cause vitiation of grahani, a condition that describes a weakened or damaged digestive system. According to Ayurvedic medicine, this can result in various diseases, all of which stem from greedy eating habits. This article will explore the nature of these diseases and the impact they can have on one's health."
399,"Excessive starvation, indulging in food intake although there is indigestion, overeating, irregular habit of eating, eating unwholesome food, indulging in food which is heavy to digest or having excessive nutritional value, food which is having cold qualities or eating chilled or frozen items, food which is dry in nature or food which brings about emaciation, contaminated food, perversion of procedures like vamana, virechana and sneha, emaciation of body due to disease, sudden migration to unsuitable place and of time and of season, suppression of  natural urges are causes for vitiation of agni. Thus, vitiated agni is unable to digest even the light food. [42-43]  This vitiated digestive agent forms an intermediate substance called ama, which turns sour (shukta) during fermentation and finally turns in poisonous substance (amavisha) [44]","Agni, the digestive fire, plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of our body, according to Ayurvedic texts. However, various factors such as excessive starvation, overeating, and consuming unwholesome or contaminated food can lead to its vitiation. Indulging in food despite indigestion or eating heavy, cold, dry, or excessively nutritious food can also harm Agni's functioning. Additionally, irregular eating habits, suppression of natural urges, and sudden changes in environment or season can further aggravate this issue. As a result, Agni becomes unable to digest even light food, leading to the formation of an intermediate substance called Ama. This Ama turns sour during fermentation and can further transform into a poisonous substance called Amavisha, causing harm to the body and mind. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced lifestyle and eating habits to ensure the proper functioning of Agni and prevent the formation of Ama and Amavisha."
400,"This poisonous substance (amavisha) manifests clinical features like flatulence, uncomfortable physical and mental miseries, headache, altered consciousness, giddiness, stiffness of back and lumbar region, yawning, body-ache, malaise, morbid thirst, fever, vomiting, tenesmus, anorexia and indigestion and it is similar to antigenic poison. [45-46]","The insidious substance known as amavisha poses a significant threat to health, with a range of distressing symptoms including flatulence, headaches, and altered consciousness. Its impact on the body is far-reaching, causing discomfort in both the physical and mental realms. The symptoms can be likened to those induced by antigenic poison, with malaise, fever, and digestive issues among its hallmarks. The stiffness in the back and lumbar region, yawning, body aches, morbid thirst, vomiting, tenesmus, anorexia, and indigestion further attest to its potency. Given its similarity to antigenic poison, understanding and addressing amavisha becomes a critical priority in maintaining overall health and wellbeing."
401,"The annavisha when associated with pitta causes daha, morbid thirst, oral diseases, amlapitta (acid peptic disorders) and various other pitta related disorders.  The same annavisha when gets associated with kapha it leads to condition like yakshma (pthiasis), peenas (coryza) and prameha (20 types of diabetes) and various other kaphaja disorders, whereas several vatika disease are caused by association of vata with the annavisha.   The annavisha when enters renal system, urine related disorders occur; similarly, kukshigata roga (ailments related to abdomen) have their origin when sakrita (feces) is involved. Rasadi pradoshaja vikara (tissue related ailments) occur when rasadi srotas are involved [47-49]","The substance known as ""annavisha"" can have significant impacts on an individual's health, depending on which bodily dosha it becomes associated with. When paired with pitta, it can cause conditions such as daha, intense thirst, oral diseases, and acid peptic disorders. In contrast, when annavisha becomes linked with kapha, it can lead to illnesses such as yakshma, coryza, and various forms of diabetes. Additionally, vata-related disorders can arise from annavisha's association with vata. Furthermore, issues related to the urinary system and abdomen can occur when annavisha becomes involved with renal and fecal matter, respectively. Lastly, tissue-related ailments can manifest when annavisha becomes intertwined with the body's tissue channels or rasadi srotas. (47-49)"
402,"The vishamagni (improper agni) causes irregularity in digestion and therefore defective formation of dhatu takes place whereas, tikshanagni (excessive agni) when associated with little quantity of fuel (in the form of food) causes depletion of dhatu (tissue elements) [50]","In the ancient science of Ayurveda, the balance and health of a person's body are closely tied to the state of their digestive fire, known as agni. When this agni, specifically referred to as vishamagni, is not functioning properly, it can lead to irregularities in digestion, causing the formation of dhatus, or tissue elements, to become defective. On the other hand, when tikshanagni, or excessive agni, is present, even in small quantities of fuel in the form of food, it can cause rapid depletion of these vital tissue elements. Proper management of agni is essential to maintain balance and promote overall health in the body."
403,If agni is sama i.e. in balanced condition and correct diet regimen (as explained in [Cha.Sa.Sutra Sthana 5] and [Cha.Sa.Vimana Sthana 1/21] are also followed then there is proper digestion of food which helps in maintaining proper balance within the dhatu [50½],"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, Agni, the digestive fire, plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the body's tissues or Dhatus. When Agni is in a state of equilibrium, or Sama, and a proper diet regimen, as outlined in Cha.Sa.Sutra Sthana 5 and Cha.Sa.Vimana Sthana 1/21, is followed, it aids in the proper digestion of food. This optimal digestive process, in turn, helps to maintain the balance within the Dhatus, contributing to overall health and well-being. Therefore, it's essential to keep Agni in a state of equilibrium through a balanced diet and lifestyle practices to support the body's natural healing mechanisms."
404,"Durbala (weak) agni brings about partial digestion of food. These partially digested bio substances then enter in circulation, which may move either in upward or downward direction [51]","Inadequate digestive power, or Durbala Agni, can lead to a less-than-optimal digestive process. When this occurs, food may be only partially broken down, resulting in the circulation of partially digested biological substances within the body. These substances may then move through the system in either an upward or downward direction, potentially causing further digestive issues and imbalances. This can ultimately affect one's overall health and well-being, highlighting the importance of maintaining a strong and balanced Agni for proper digestion and absorption of nutrients. [51]"
405,"When partially digested and partially undigested bio substances moves downward in gastrointestinal tract it produces a disorder known as grahanigada. In this particular stage the entire food material remains in the state of vidagdha state (partially transformed/sour).  In this condition the individual may pass stools in excessive quantity or frequency wherein stools may be loose, with thin consistency or in the form of pellet like stool/bound stool (vibaddham) and morbid thirst, anorexia, distaste, excessive watering of mouth, blackout, edema of legs and hands, pain in bones and finger joints, vomiting, fever, eructation having either metallic smell or undigested food and having bitter or sour taste are observed [52-54]","Grahanigada is a disorder that arises when partially digested and partially undigested bio substances make their way through the gastrointestinal tract. At this stage, the food material exists in a vidagdha state, meaning it has been partially transformed and has turned sour. This condition can lead to excessive stool passage, which may be loose, thin, or pellet-like in consistency, and may be accompanied by morbid thirst, anorexia, distaste, excessive watering of the mouth, blackouts, edema of the legs and hands, pain in bones and finger joints, vomiting, fever, eructation with a metallic smell or one that resembles undigested food, and bitter or sour tastes [52-54]."
406,"Premonitory signs and symptoms are thirst, malaise, diminution of strength, burning sensation; delay in digestion and heaviness in body [55]","Paying attention to premonitory signs and symptoms can help individuals identify potential health issues before they become more serious. Some of these early warning signals include feelings of thirst, malaise, and a diminution of strength. Additionally, a burning sensation, delayed digestion, and heaviness in the body may also indicate that something is amiss. By recognizing and addressing these symptoms promptly, individuals can take proactive steps to maintain their overall health and well-being (55)."
407,"Grahani is seat of agni and it is so called since it holds/retains the food (for proper digestion and assimilation). It holds the food just above the umbilical region and it is supported and nourished by the agni. Grahani with help of agni holds the undigested food and pushes forward digested food, but when agni becomes weak and vitiated due to vidagdha ahara murchita dosha (afflicted by improperly digested food) i.e sama dosha(dosha associated with ama) it vitiates the grahani and releases food in the form of ama i.e. undigested form [56-57]","The region known as Grahani, located just above the umbilical area, plays a crucial role in our digestive system as it serves as the seat of Agni, the digestive fire. It is named Grahani because of its ability to hold and retain food, allowing for proper digestion and assimilation. This process is facilitated through the support and nourishment provided by Agni. However, when Agni becomes weakened and vitiated due to improperly digested food, or what is known as sama dosha, it in turn affects the Grahani. This affliction can lead to the release of undigested food in the form of ama, a toxic byproduct that can have negative impacts on one's health."
408,"Grahani is classified into four types viz vataja, pittaja, kaphaja and sannipataja. On the basis of the classification, etiological factors, symptoms and signs are being mentioned one by one [58]","Grahani, a digestive disorder in Ayurvedic medicine, is categorized into four primary types: vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, and sannipataja. Each type has specific etiological factors, symptoms, and signs, which help in diagnosis and treatment. The vataja grahani is caused by an imbalance of vata dosha, leading to symptoms such as bloating, constipation, and digestive discomfort. Pittaja grahani, on the other hand, is caused by an excess of pitta dosha, resulting in symptoms such as heartburn, acidity, and loose stools. Kaphaja grahani occurs due to an imbalance in kapha dosha, leading to symptoms such as heaviness in the stomach, loss of appetite, and slow digestion. Lastly, sannipataja grahani is a combination of all three doshas, resulting in severe symptoms and requiring immediate medical attention. Understanding this classification system is crucial for personalized Ayurvedic treatment and management of grahani."
409,"Excessive indulgence in diet having katu (pungent), tikta (bitter), kashaya (astringent) dominant food, which is dry in nature or having absorptive or emaciative qualities; cold, chilled or frozen items, eating quantitatively less amount of food, suppression of natural urges and excessive sexual intercourse contribute to aggravation of vata dosha which encompass the agni causing suppression of agni [59½]","Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial in Ayurvedic principles, and excessive indulgence in certain types of food can disrupt this balance. A diet that is high in katu (pungent), tikta (bitter), and kashaya (astringent) flavors and is dry in nature can contribute to the aggravation of vata dosha. This imbalance can also be caused by consuming cold, chilled, or frozen items, eating quantitatively less food, and suppressing natural urges. Moreover, excessive sexual intercourse can also have a negative impact on vata dosha, leading to the suppression of agni. Therefore, it is important to be mindful of one's diet and lifestyle to ensure a healthy balance of doshas and maintain optimal agni."
410,"Symptoms of vatika grahani are as follows:  Food is not easily digested and gets fermented (leading to sourness), roughness of skin, dryness of throat and mouth, craving for food and thirst is increased, timira (blurred vision), tinnitus, continuous pain in flanks, thighs, pelvis, neck region, vishuchika (piercing pain all over the body with vomiting and diarhea), chest pain/discomfort in cardiac region, emaciation, weakness, distaste, cutting pain, craving for sweets, sour and saline food (madhuradi rasa), reduced mental strength, adhmana (distention of abdomen) occurs during digestion and after completion of digestion whereas the patient feels abdominal comfort just after eating the food.   Patient expresses repeated doubts that he is suffering from vatika disorders, gulma (abdominal tumor), heart disease and splenomegaly.   Stools are evacuated with difficulty and consume time. Feces are either watery, dry, small sized associated with flatus and undigested food. Frequency of stool is increased and patient may suffer from cough and breathing difficulty [60-64]","Vataiga grahani, a digestive disorder in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, presents a range of symptoms that affect the digestive system and overall health. The primary symptom includes difficulty in digestion, often resulting in food fermentation and increased sourness. The patient may also experience roughness of skin, dryness in the mouth and throat, and increased thirst and food cravings. Other symptoms encompass various bodily pains, including continuous aches in the flanks, thighs, pelvis, neck, and chest regions, as well as cutting pain, distention, and discomfort in the abdomen during digestion.

Moreover, patients with vataiga grahani may suffer from additional ailments such as blurred vision, tinnitus, emaciation, weakness, distaste, and vomiting with diarrhea. A craving for sweets, sour, and salty foods may arise, accompanied by reduced mental strength and repeated doubts about suffering from various disorders, such as heart disease, abdominal tumors, or splenomegaly. The condition also affects bowel movements, causing difficulty in passing stools, which may be watery, dry, or small, with undigested food particles, flatus, and increased frequency. Coughing and breathing difficulty may also accompany this disorder."
411,"Katu (spicy), ajeerna (undigestable food), vidahi (food causing eructation), amla (sour), kshara (alkali) and other food items which aggravate pitta are causes for pittaja grahani. The aggravated pitta hampers the function of agni similar to condition wherein hot water extinguishes fire [65]","Pittaja Grahani, a digestive disorder in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, is primarily caused by the consumption of certain aggravating foods. These include Katu (spicy) and Amla (sour) items, which can increase the Pitta dosha in the body. Additionally, Ajeerna (indigestible) and Vidahi (food causing eructation) foods can further disrupt the digestive process. Furthermore, Kshara (alkali) and other similarly aggravating food items can contribute to the onset of this condition. When Pitta becomes aggravated, it can impair the function of Agni, leading to a situation similar to attempting to extinguish a fire with hot water - it only serves to make the problem worse. Therefore, it is essential to avoid these aggravating foods and maintain a balanced diet to prevent and manage Pittaja Grahani."
412,"The stools have undigested food particles having either bluish-yellowish tinge or yellow in color and are loose/watery. The eructions have foul smell and sour taste, there is burning sensation in the cardiac region (retro-sternal) and throat, anorexia and thirst are the symptoms of pittaja grahani [66]","Grahani, a digestive disorder mentioned in Ayurvedic texts, is characterized by a specific set of symptoms, including those related to stool and eructation. If a person has Pittaja Grahani, they may notice undigested food particles in their stool, which can have a bluish-yellowish tinge or be yellow and have a loose, watery consistency. Additionally, their flatulence may have a foul smell and sour taste, accompanied by a burning sensation in the cardiac region (retro-sternal) and throat. Two other common symptoms of this condition are anorexia (loss of appetite) and thirst."
413,"Heavy to digest or excessively unctuous foods, frozen or chilled items or food having cold nature or food which has qualities similar to kapha, excessive intake of food and sleeping just after the meals hamper the function of agni and simultaneously vitiates kapha [67]","A balanced agni, or digestive fire, is crucial for maintaining optimal health and well-being in Ayurvedic medicine. However, certain types of food and eating habits can hinder the function of agni and contribute to an imbalance in kapha. Specifically, heavy and hard-to-digest foods, excessive amounts of food, and consuming cold or iced foods and drinks can all have a negative impact. Additionally, eating just after waking up from sleep or indulging in prolonged naps immediately after meals can further disrupt agni and vitiate kapha. It is important to be mindful of these factors and strive for a balanced and mindful eating routine to support overall health and well-being."
414,"Food is digested with difficulty, nausea, vomiting and anorexia are its symptoms. The other symptoms are feeling of coated mouth and sweet taste, has cough, increased tendency to spit, pinasa (nasal discharge), feeling of heaviness in chest, feeling as if there is no movement in abdomen, heavy abdomen, eructation with foul smelling and sweet taste; patient does not feel enthusiastic and there is suppression of libido. Stools are mixed with undigested items and mucous and are heavy; although patient is not emaciated still he feels weakness and laziness [68-70]","The digestion process becomes a challenging task, accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and a loss of appetite. Other associated manifestations include a constant feeling of a coated mouth and a sweet taste, frequent coughing, and an increased tendency to spit. Additional symptoms such as pinasa (nasal discharge), a sensation of heaviness in the chest, and the feeling that there is no movement in the abdomen further exacerbate the condition. Moreover, patients often report experiencing a heavy abdomen, eructation with a foul or sweet taste. A lack of enthusiasm and a suppressed libido are also common. Despite not showing significant weight loss, patients often complain of weakness and laziness. Stool consistency becomes loose, containing undigested items and mucous, becoming heavy and contributing to the overall discomfort and unease."
415,Four types of agni have been previously explained in Roganika Vimana. Except samagni other three types of agni contribute to the grahani dosha [71],"In the ancient Ayurvedic text, Roganika Vimana, the concept of Agni, or digestive fire, is discussed in detail. There are four distinct types of Agni mentioned, namely, Sama, Vishama, Tikshna, and Manda Agni. While Sama Agni is balanced and contributes to healthy digestion, the other three types - Vishama, Tikshna, and Manda Agni - can lead to grahani dosha or digestive disorders when they become excessive. Grahani dosha is a common Ayurvedic concept that refers to various digestive ailments, such as indigestion, malabsorption, and irritable bowel syndrome, among others. Therefore, understanding the different types of Agni and their impact on digestion is crucial for maintaining optimal health and preventing grahani dosha."
416,"Sannipataja grahani occurs by simultaneous vitiation of vata, pitta and kapha. In such conditions etiological factors, symptoms and signs are of all the three dosha appear. Hereafter treatment of grahanidosha is expounded [72]","Sannipataja Grahani is a specific type of dosha imbalance that involves the simultaneous vitiation of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. This condition is characterized by a unique set of etiological factors, symptoms, and signs that arise from the imbalance of all three doshas. Due to its complexity, treating Sannipataja Grahani requires a comprehensive understanding of the imbalance and its effects on the body. In Ayurvedic texts, the treatment of Grahani dosha is expounded in detail, taking into account the specific needs of each individual dosha imbalance. By addressing the root causes of the imbalance and promoting the restoration of balance, Ayurvedic treatment seeks to alleviate the symptoms and signs associated with this condition. (word count: 111)"
417,"When the doshas are located in grahani and are associated with incomplete digested food then vishtambha (constipation), excessive salivation, bodyache, burning sensation, anorexia and heaviness is felt by patient which are symptoms of ama and in such a condition vamana (emetic therapy) with lukewarm water or with decoction of madanaphala (Randia spinosa), pippali (Piper longum) and sarshapa (Brassica campestris) should be administered [73-74]","Constipation, excessive salivation, body aches, burning sensations, loss of appetite, and feelings of heaviness are all symptoms that can indicate a patient is experiencing an excess of doshas, or imbalanced bodily energies, located in the grahani (stomach) and associated with improperly digested food. This condition, known as vishtambha, or constipation, is often accompanied by ama, a toxic buildup of waste products in the body. In such cases, vamana, or emetic therapy, is recommended to eliminate the toxins. This therapy can be performed using lukewarm water or a decoction made from madanaphala (Randia spinosa), pippali (Piper longum), and sarshapa (Brassica campestris) to help restore balance to the body and alleviate the symptoms of vishtambha and ama."
418,"If the ama is in pakvashaya and in anutklishtha (stuck, not ready to come out) condition then stravana (increasing secretion) with deepana dravyas should be administered whereas if ama gets absorbed along with rasa dhatu and if it pervades throughout the body then langhana and pachana should be advised [75]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, if a patient is experiencing an ""ama"" condition, where the waste products in the body are not properly eliminated and have accumulated in the ""pakvashaya"" area, specific treatments should be administered. In the case where the ama is in an ""anutklishtha"" condition, meaning it is stuck and not ready to come out, ""stravana"" with ""deepana dravyas"" should be used. ""Stravana"" refers to increasing the secretion of fluids and other substances in the body, while ""deepana dravyas"" are substances that increase digestion and metabolism. On the other hand, if the ama has been absorbed along with ""rasa dhatu"" (nutritive fluid) and has pervaded throughout the body, treatments such as ""langhana"" and ""pachana"" should be advised. ""Langhana"" refers to reducing or eliminating something, while ""pachana"" refers to digestion or metabolism. These treatments aim to eliminate the accumulated waste products from the body and restore balance to the system."
419,"After cleansing of amashaya, liquid gruel of rice (peya) fortified with panchakola etc. drugs should be administered. Light and easy to digest food along with deepana drugs may be given [76]","After the process of cleansing the amashaya, or the stomach and upper intestine in accordance with Ayurvedic practices, it is recommended to consume a light and easily digestible liquid gruel made from rice, known as peya. This gruel should be fortified with panchakola, a group of five Ayurvedic ingredients known for their medicinal properties.

If sama mala is contaminated by sheeta guna and kapha or has a watery or very compact consistency, it may not follow this rule. However, when it retains its normal consistency, sama mala is expected to sink due to the heaviness or gurutva caused by ama, or undigested food particles.

Sneha, which refers to oils and fats, has the unique ability to stimulate the agni, making it more efficient and promoting better digestion and assimilation of food. This, in turn, can lead to improved overall health and well-being."
478,"If the patient has inefficient digestive power and voids undigested food in excess in stools or frequency of motions is more, then appropriate quantity of ghrita fortified by deepana medicines should again be given. Thus, samana vata is regularized and moves in its normal tract. As samana vata is associated with agni it instantaneously promotes the strength of agni.   Digestive power thus stimulated by ghrita cannot be suppressed even by heavy meals [202-203]","In cases where a patient experiences impaired digestive abilities, leading to excessive undigested food in their stools or increased frequency of bowel movements, it is recommended to administer an appropriate quantity of ghee (ghrita) fortified with deepan (appetizer) medicines. This approach aids in regulating samana vata, enabling it to return to its normal course. Given that samana vata is closely connected to agni, this method also serves to instantly bolster agni's strength. The invigorated digestive power induced by ghee remains unaffected even in the face of heavy meals, thus emphasizing the importance of this remedial measure in addressing digestive concerns as outlined in ancient Ayurvedic texts (202-203)."
479,"If patient finds difficulty in evacuation of stools due to hardness in stools then salt mixed ghrita should be administered in between the food.  (Note:Lavana rasa has vata anulomana action and also increases secretions, therefore hardness of stool is reduced and stools are easily evacuated) [204]","Constipation, a common issue faced by many, can be effectively managed through natural remedies. One such solution is the use of salt-mixed ghee (ghrita), which has shown significant results in alleviating constipation symptoms caused by hard stools. The combination of lavana rasa (salt) and ghee offers vata anulomana action, promoting a harmonious balance within the body. Additionally, lavana rasa enhances secretions, further assisting in reducing stool hardness and ensuring effortless evacuation. For optimal results, this mixture can be consumed between meals, making it a convenient and accessible option for those struggling with constipation relief."
480,If agni is suppressed due to ruksha guna then either ghrita or taila fortified with deepaniya drugs should be administered [205],"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, it is crucial to maintain the balance of agni, or digestive fire, for optimal health. If agni becomes suppressed due to the presence of ruksha guna, or a dry quality, it is recommended that ghrita (clarified butter) or taila (oil) be administered. These substances should be fortified with deepaniya drugs, which are agents that enhance the digestive fire. This approach can help restore balance to the system and promote proper digestion and absorption of nutrients. By following these guidelines, individuals can support their overall health and well-being according to the principles of Ayurveda."
481,"If excessive intake of sneha is cause for agnimandya then powder preparation, arishta asava as mentioned earlier are beneficial; whereas if anal area gets adhered by unformed stools then taila, sura and asava preparation should be administered [206]","When it comes to addressing health concerns in Ayurvedic medicine, specific remedies are recommended based on the underlying issue. For instance, if excessive consumption of ""sneha"" (oil or fat) has led to ""agnimandya"" (weakened digestive fire), it is advised to use powder preparations and ""arishta"" or ""asava"" (fermented alcoholic beverages) to correct this imbalance. Conversely, if the anal area becomes afflicted with ""unformed stools,"" it is recommended to administer ""taila"" (oil) or ""sura"" (a type of alcohol) and ""asava"" preparations to alleviate this problem. (206)"
482,If udavarta (mis-peristalsis) is responsible for suppression of agni then niruha and sneha basti should be administered; whereas if dosha vriddhi is the cause for suppression of agni then shodhana as per dosha is indicated [207],"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, addressing the suppression of Agni, or digestive fire, requires a careful analysis of the underlying causes. If Udavarta, or mis-peristalsis, is identified as the root cause, then a combination of Niruha and Sneha Basti, specialized Ayurvedic enema therapies, should be administered. Conversely, if Dosha Vriddhi, or an aggravation of bodily humors, is determined to be the cause, Shodhana, or elimination therapy tailored to the specific dosha, is indicated to restore balance and promote optimal digestion. This approach, deeply rooted in Ayurvedic wisdom, offers a personalized and holistic path to rejuvenate and harmonize the body's essential processes."
483,"If suppression of agni has taken place due to diseases than ghrita is best for agni deepana but if fasting is the causes of agni suppression than yavagu (gruel) along with ghrita should be taken. Ghrita when taken in between the meal, it increases the strength, stimulates the digestion and nourishes the body [208]","Agni, the digestive fire, can be negatively impacted by diseases, leading to its suppression and hindered digestion. In such cases, ghrita, a type of clarified butter, is highly beneficial for rekindling the digestive fire due to its deepan (stimulant) properties. On the other hand, if fasting is the cause of agni suppression, a combination of yavagu (gruel) and ghrita is recommended, as it provides necessary nourishment while also supporting digestion. Moreover, consuming ghrita between meals can further enhance its benefits by increasing strength, boosting digestion, and nourishing the body, making it a valuable addition to one's dietary regimen. (208)"
484,"If agnimandya has been chronic and patient has become indolent, weak and emaciated then soup of prasaha group of animals (animals who snatch their food) fortified with amla drugs is advised. As this meat soups are light for digestion having penetrating, hot, purifying qualities stimulates the agni. Further as the animals feed on other animals their meat mamsa is well nourished and compact therefore causes quick nourishment [209-210]","In instances where Agnimandya, or a decreased digestive fire, has become chronic and a patient finds themselves becoming indolent, weak, and emaciated, traditional Ayurvedic texts suggest a remedy in the form of a fortified soup. This soup is derived from the Prasaha group of animals, those who snatch or seize their food, and is enhanced with the addition of Amla drugs. This meat soup is particularly beneficial due to its light and easy-to-digest nature, as well as its penetrating, hot, and purifying qualities that serve to stimulate the digestive fire. Furthermore, the meat of these animals is well-nourished and compact as a result of their own carnivorous diets, allowing for quick and efficient nourishment of the consumer. (209-210)"
485,"Fasting or over eating does not stimulate agni, as like fire in environment is extinguished if there is no fuel supply or if excessive fuel covers the agni. [211]","The concept of Agni, often referred to as the digestive fire in Ayurveda, follows a delicate balance that can easily be disrupted. According to Ayurvedic principles, neither fasting nor overeating supports the optimal functioning of Agni. Just as a fire in the environment requires a consistent fuel supply to burn brightly, so too does Agni need a balanced amount of food for efficient digestion. Conversely, excessive fuel, in the form of overeating, can smother Agni, much like too much fuel can extinguish a fire, leading to improper digestion and potential health issues."
486,"Proper intake of sneha, followed by eating proper food preparations as well as appropriate use of various churna, arishtha, sura and asava along with proper medication as per condition, enhances the power of agni similar to the environmental fire which remains stable for long duration when good hard wood catches fire [212-213]","In Ayurvedic practices, the concept of ""sneha"" or internal oleation plays a significant role in enhancing the digestive fire or ""agni."" By consuming proper food preparations and utilizing various churnas, arishthas, suras, and asavas as directed according to one's condition, the power of agni can be significantly improved. This internal fire, when stoked correctly, remains stable and robust, much like an environmental fire that burns steadily when fueled by good hardwood. The key to unlocking this stability lies in the proper consumption and application of these Ayurvedic remedies and medications, allowing for optimal digestion and overall health enhancement."
487,"Intake of food mixed with sneha and as per dietetic rules and regulation stabilizes the digestive power.   Eating wholesome diet in appropriate quantity after previously eaten food is digested helps in maintaining good health for long duration.   A person should workout so that agni vriddhi takes place without disturbing the balance of dhatus. Such agni digests the food, maintains health and nourishment, promotes longevity and increases strength. The same dosha when vitiated causes mandagni, tikshnagni and vishamagni and such a vitiated agni gives rise to various diseases.   Management of mandagni has been explained previously henceforth management of ativriddha agni will be explained [214-216]","A balanced intake of food, combined with sneha and adhering to dietary regulations, plays a crucial role in stabilizing digestive power. Furthermore, consuming wholesome meals in appropriate quantities after previous meals have been digested contributes to long-term health maintenance. It is also essential to engage in physical exercise to stimulate agni vriddhi without disrupting the equilibrium of dhatus. This balanced agni facilitates proper food digestion, supports health and nourishment, extends lifespan, and enhances strength. However, when this same dosha becomes vitiated, it may lead to mandagni, tikshnagni, or vishamagni, which in turn can cause various diseases. Having previously discussed mandagni management, we will now explain how to manage ativriddha agni (excessive agni) in the text [214-216]."
488,"Person having diminished kapha, aggravated pitta and associated vata leads to increase in the ushma of agni resulting in enhancing the capacity and power of agni. In such patient if the body is already undernourished, vata increases which further strengths the agni wherein both, together with help of tikshna guna digests the food even if taken frequently. After digestion of food, the increased agni starts digesting rakta, etc dhatus also [217-219]","In Ayurvedic medicine, the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - is crucial for maintaining optimal health. An individual with a reduced Kapha and heightened Pitta, accompanied by a slightly increased Vata, may experience a boost in their digestive fire or ""Agni."" This enhanced Agni capacity allows for more frequent food intake without compromising digestion. Furthermore, the robust Agni, together with the sharpness of the Tikshna Guna, facilitates not only the digestion of food but also begins to break down other bodily tissues like Rakta. However, if the body is already undernourished, excessive Vata could further strengthen Agni, potentially leading to adverse effects if not managed properly."
489,"Consequently, the patient becomes weak and death may occur due to disease. The patient feels better on consuming the food but feels worn out along with blackouts when food is digested. Morbid thirst, dyspnea, burning sensation, fainting etc are observed in disease caused due to atyagni.   Digestive power can be pacified by taking foods and drinks which are heavy to digest, unctuous, cold, sweet and liquid same way as fire is extinguishes by water in nature. The patient should be administered food at regular interval although previously eaten meal is undigested so that atyagni due to lack of fuel does not digest the tissues [220-222]","In diseases caused by an imbalance in digestive power, known as atyagni in ancient medical texts, the patient experiences a variety of distressing symptoms. As digestion occurs, the individual may feel a sense of improvement, only to be followed by weakness, fatigue, and even blackouts once the food has been processed. Other symptoms such as excessive thirst, shortness of breath, and a burning sensation can also arise. To manage atyagni, it is recommended that patients consume foods that are heavy, unctuous, cold, sweet, and liquid in nature, as these properties have a pacifying effect, much like water extinguishing a fire. Additionally, it is important that patients are fed at regular intervals, even if their previous meal remains undigested, to prevent atyagni from causing further damage to bodily tissues due to a lack of fuel for digestion."
490,"Payasa (milk pudding), krishara (thick gruel prepared of rice and lentils), snigdha (unctuous), paiṣṭika (resembling flour paste), various jaggery products, meat of aquatic animals or marshy area especially fish which is mainly in smooth (not salty) and stable water and roasted meat of sheep may be given to pacify the atyagni [223-224]","In the context of pacifying atyagni, or excessive hunger, the Ayurvedic text suggests several food items that can provide relief. These include payasa, a milk-based pudding, and krishara, a thick gruel made from rice and lentils. Both of these foods are described as being unctuous, or having a high fat content, which can help to satisfy hunger and nourish the body. Additionally, paiṣṭika, a type of flour paste, is recommended, as well as various products made from jaggery, a type of unrefined sugar. The text also mentions that meat from aquatic animals or marshy areas, particularly fish from still, fresh waters, can be helpful in calming atyagni. Roasted meat from sheep is another option for those seeking to pacify this extreme hunger."
491,Yavagu (thick gruel) mixed with bee wax or ghrita should be given whenever patient feels hungry. Mantha prepared from wheat flour or venesection may be advised. Milk medicated with jeevaniya group of drugs along with sugar and ghrita may be given [225-226],"In the traditional Indian medical system of Ayurveda, the consumption of yavagu, a thick gruel, is recommended for patients, especially when they express feelings of hunger. To enhance its therapeutic value, it can be combined with either beeswax or ghee (ghrita). In addition, mantha, a medicinal paste prepared from wheat flour, can also be advised. Alternatively, venesection may be suggested to alleviate certain health conditions. Another nourishing option includes milk infused with jeevaniya drugs, a group of rejuvenating drugs, and further enriched with sugar and ghee for improved taste and medicinal benefits (Charaka Samhita, 225-226)."
492,"Paste of fruits, substances containing oil like tila (sesame seeds) with sugar and meat soup with ghee pacifies the agni [227]","In the realm of dietary considerations, certain combinations of foods are believed to have a pacifying effect on the digestive fire, known as ""agni"" in traditional Indian medicine. According to this concept, a paste made from a blend of fruits and substances containing oil, such as sesame seeds, when combined with sugar, can help to calm and soothe the agni. Similarly, a nourishing meat soup cooked with ghee is also recommended for its ability to pacify the digestive fire and promote overall balance in the body. These recommendations are based on the idea that the soothing properties of these foods can help to counteract the excess heat that can contribute to aggravated agni, thereby promoting better digestion and overall health."
493,"The patient should take ghrita with beeswax along with cold water as anupana. Patient may take wheat flour with milk and ghee.  Patient may be advised to take three sneha i.e. ghee, abinal fat, bone-marrow fortified with meat soup of animals residing in marshy areas. Milk mixed with wheat flour and curd along with three sneha (ghrita, vasa, majja) may be given. Bark of udumbara mixed with human milk and milk pudding prepared from udumbara and human milk helps in pacifying the atyagni [228-230]","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, the treatment for certain ailments includes the consumption of ghrita (ghee) in conjunction with beeswax, as advised by ancient texts [228]. This mixture, when taken with cold water as an anupana (vehicle or carrier), is believed to provide soothing effects to the body. Additionally, patients may also consume wheat flour mixed with milk and ghee to enhance their dietary intake. Another recommended practice is to consume three sneha (fats), including ghee, abinal fat, and bone marrow, fortified with meat soup derived from animals residing in marshy areas. Moreover, combining milk, curd, and wheat flour, all sourced from udumbara and combined with human milk, is thought to pacify atyagni, a condition characterized by excessive heat or aggravation in the body [230]. These traditional Ayurvedic remedies offer a unique and holistic approach to health and wellness, focusing on restoring balance and harmony within the body's systems."
494,Milk medicated with syama and trivritta may be advised for virechana for alleviating the pitta followed by diet of milk pudding. Expert physician should follow the line of treatment after proper examination of patient [231],"In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, the use of milk medicated with syama and trivritta is often recommended as part of the virechana treatment to help alleviate excessive pitta in the body. This time-honored remedy is traditionally followed by a diet that includes milk pudding, creating a soothing effect on the aggravated doshas. However, it is crucial to note that this line of treatment should only be administered under the careful guidance of an experienced Ayurvedic physician. After conducting a thorough examination, the expert physician will determine the most appropriate course of action to promote healing, ensuring that each patient receives personalized care based on their unique needs. (231)"
495,"Foods which are sweet in taste, fatty, increases kapha and heavy to digest should be given. All food items are good for atyagni and sleeping after meals during day time is beneficial in atyagni. Patient who takes fatty diet even though he is not hungry does not succumb to death. If he is suffering from atyagni on the other hand such diet pattern is nutritional. Whenever due to medication and diet, kapha is increased; it subdues pitta and vata and normalizes the agni.  When dhatus are in equilibrium anna gets digested resulting in increase in nutrition, longevity and strength [232-234]","In the context of atyagni, or increased digestive fire, it is recommended to consume foods that are sweet in taste, fatty, and heavier to digest. Interestingly, consuming a fatty diet, even if not hungry, may not lead to adverse effects but instead promote nutrition and strength in individuals with atyagni. Furthermore, increased kapha, which can result from such a diet, can help suppress vata and pitta, thereby normalizing agni. As dhatus, or bodily tissues, reach equilibrium through medication and diet, proper digestion of food occurs, leading to increased nutrition, longevity, and strength. Additionally, daytime sleeping after meals is beneficial for those with atyagni."
496,Taking of wholesome and unwholesome foods together in diet is known as samashana.  Vishamashana is defined as taking food either in excess quantity or very little quantity and also if taken before or after appropriate time.   Adhyashana is having food even though previously eaten food is not yet digested.  All the above three are causes for death or give rise to serious disorders [235-236],"In the ancient science of Ayurveda, diet plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. Three types of improper eating habits are highlighted in classical texts as harmful to health: Samashana, Vishamashana, and Adhyashana. Samashana refers to consuming both wholesome and unwholesome foods together in a single meal, which can disrupt the balance of the body and mind. Vishamashana, on the other hand, involves consuming food either in excess or insufficient quantities, or at inappropriate times, leading to imbalances that can result in severe disorders or even death. Adhyashana is defined as eating food before the previously consumed meal has been digested, which can hinder proper digestion and absorption, leading to health issues. All three practices can cause serious harm to one's health, highlighting the importance of mindful eating habits in Ayurveda."
497,"If morning eaten food is undigested and still if anyone takes evening food it may not be more vitiative since in day time all the srotas (channels) are dilated and heart is active similar to the lotus which blossoms with sunrise. During daytime, exercise, other physical and mental activities (cause heart to pump blood properly to) prevent the genesis of kleda (excess moisture) in various dhatus [237-239]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the timing and digestion of meals play a significant role in maintaining overall health. According to ancient texts, consuming undigested food from the morning into the evening may not have a highly adverse effect, particularly during daylight hours. This is because, during the day, all of the body's srotas or channels are dilated, and the heart is particularly active, akin to a lotus that blooms with sunrise. The increased heart activity, combined with daytime physical and mental activities, promotes proper blood circulation and prevents the accumulation of excess moisture, or kleda, in various tissues, ultimately supporting optimal health and digestion."
498,"As unspoiled milk when mixed with fresh milk, the mixture does not get spoiled and will get uniformly mixed, so is the condition when in daytime previously eaten food although not digested still a person can digest another meal [240]","The process of digestion is a complex one, closely analogous to the mixing of two liquids. Just as unspoiled milk, when combined with fresh milk, maintains its quality and mixes uniformly, so too can our bodies handle the digestion of additional food even if previously consumed meals have not been fully digested. The human body is a remarkable machine, able to manage and balance multiple processes simultaneously, ensuring that digestion remains efficient and effective throughout the day. Even in the absence of complete digestion, our bodies continue to process food, allowing for the successful integration of multiple meals."
499,"In the night, the channels are closed, so is the heart which functions at slow rate as demand is less, the apakva ahara rasa increases in viscosity; thus ama adheres to the dhatus and if another food is taken the indigestion causes more apakva ahara rasa causing disease. The condition resembles, wherein uncooked milk mixed with warm milk gets spoiled. Therefore, a wise person should not take meals if food taken at night is not digested; this will surely effect strength and life of a person [241-243]","In the stillness of the night, our bodies' rhythms shift, with channels closing and a slower heartbeat reflecting reduced demand. This change in physiology allows the apakva ahara rasa, or partially digested food, to increase in viscosity, creating an environment where ama, or toxins, can adhere to the dhatus, or tissues. If another meal is consumed in this state, indigestion ensues, exacerbating the buildup of apakva ahara rasa, potentially leading to disease. This situation is akin to uncooked milk spoiling when mixed with warm milk. As such, it is crucial for one to avoid consuming additional food if their previous meal remains undigested, ensuring the preservation of strength and overall well-being."
500,"To conclude, this chapter has addressed the following points:  Qualities of antaragni, Manner in which agni does dharana (sustenance) of the body, Manner in which food is digested, How digested food functions? How different types of agni does nutrition after digesting the fuel? Development of rasadi dhatus and their associated waste products after digestions at dhatu level (tissue level) How aphrodisiacs act instantly and time taken for the dhatu formation and order of development? Reason why diseases are located in one part of the body and role of antaragni in disease formation, Diseases caused by abnormal agni Definition of grahani and sign and symptoms of grahani dosha, Premonitory symptoms along with four types of grahani dosha their signs and symptoms with treatment as per various condition, How condition of atyagni is generated and its treatment. [244-249]","In conclusion, this chapter elucidates various critical aspects related to the concept of agni in our body. It explains the qualities of antaragni, the inner fire responsible for sustenance and digestion. The manner in which food is digested and how the digested food functions to nourish different types of tissues is also discussed. Furthermore, it delves into the development of rasadi dhatus, or tissue elements, and their associated waste products at the tissue level. The text also shed lights on the instantaneous effect of aphrodisiacs and the time taken for dhatu formation and their order of development. It also explains why diseases locate in a specific part of the body and the role of antaragni in disease formation. Additionally, it provides definitions, signs, symptoms, and treatments for grahani dosha, a type of digestive disorder. Lastly, it discusses the condition of atyagni, or excessive fire, and its treatment."
501,"Herewith, fifteenth chapter related to Grahani Chikitsa which was unavailable as part of Chikitsa Sthana of Agnivesha Tantra supplemented by Dridhabala has been completed (15).","The long-awaited addition to the ancient medical text, Agnivesha Tantra, has been completed with the completion of the fifteenth chapter on Grahani Chikitsa. This chapter, supplemented by Dridhabala, was lost over time and its inclusion in the text is a significant development in the revival of ancient medical practices. The Grahani Chikitsa chapter focuses on the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal ailments, providing valuable insights and guidance for medical practitioners and scholars in the field. This completion marks a major milestone in the preservation and propagation of ancient medical knowledge."
502,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Udara chikitsa"" (Management of generalized enlargement of abdomen). Thus said Lord Atreya [1-2]","In the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, Lord Atreya's teachings in the chapter ""Udara Chikitsa"" hold immense significance. This section is dedicated to the exploration and management of a prevalent condition known as generalized enlargement of the abdomen. By delving into the knowledge contained within this chapter, we shall gain a deeper understanding of the causes, symptoms, and holistic approaches to treating this ailment, as passed down through generations of Ayurvedic practitioners."
503,"Sage Punarvasu was residing in Mount Kailasa (which is similar to Nandana Vana) and was accompanied with Siddha (a group of highly skilled individuals possessing eight supernatural faculties) and Vidhyadara (the possessor of knowledge of science/super human personality is termed Vidyadhara). In Mount Kailasa, Sage Punarvasu  was seated like very embodiment of dharma (righteousness) and was engaged in practicing austerity. ","In the revered abode of Mount Kailasa, a location known for its resemblance to the celestial Nandana Vana, lived the venerable Sage Punarvasu. His company was none other than the highly skilled Siddhas, a group recognized for their eight extraordinary siddhis, and the learned Vidyadharas, individuals renowned for their knowledge and superhuman personalities. Seated amidst this gathering, Sage Punarvasu embodied the very essence of dharma, engaging in rigorous practices of austerity. His commitment to righteousness and dedication to his spiritual pursuits were evident, making Mount Kailasa a sacred site of immense spiritual significance."
504,Sage Punarvasu is the foremost among those who are proficient in the knowledge of Ayurveda and involved in promulgating the science of medicine. Agnivesha spoke addressing to such self controlled great sage Punarvasu. [3-4],"In the realm of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, Sage Punarvasu stands out as a leading authority. His proficiency in the science of life, as Ayurveda is known, is unparalleled, and his contributions to its promulgation are immense. It was with great respect and reverence that Agnivesha, another esteemed sage, addressed him. As a self-controlled and great sage, Punarvasu's wisdom and teachings were sought after by many, making him a guiding light in the field of Ayurveda."
505,"Sage Agnivesha addressing Punarvasu, said “Oh Lord!” it is observed that the patient of udara suffers from dryness of the mouth, emaciation of body, distension of abdomen and flanks, impaired digestion, loss of physical strength, inability to consume food, inability to perform any physical activities and depression; such patients sooner or later die due to the illness in the absence of treatment just like an orphan. ","In the ancient text of Ayurveda, Sage Agnivesha once addressed Punarvasu with a solemn warning about the grave consequences of a specific medical condition known as ""udara."" He described the unfortunate patient suffering from this ailment as experiencing extreme dryness of the mouth, significant weight loss, and a distended abdomen. Additionally, the individual would face impaired digestion and a loss of physical strength, making it difficult for them to consume food or engage in any physical activities. Moreover, they would likely suffer from depression and, without proper treatment, ultimately meet a fate similar to that of an orphan, left alone and without support to face their inevitable demise."
506,"I wish to hear the proper description of this disease from my teacher Lord Punarvasu in regards to its etiology, the number, the premonitory symptoms, clinical presentation and treatment. [5-7]","As a devoted student, you have turned to your esteemed teacher, Lord Punarvasu, to gain a comprehensive understanding of a specific disease. You seek a detailed explanation of its origin, the number of stages it may have, the early warning signs, how it manifests clinically, and the appropriate treatments. By gaining this knowledge, you hope to deepen your understanding of this ailment, and better prepare yourself for any related studies or discussions that may follow."
507,"Enthused by the student’s questioning, Lord Punarvasu spoke about the beneficial topics for the well being of human. [8]","In the midst of a captivating discourse, Lord Punarvasu's enthusiasm was palpable as he engaged with the students' thoughtful questions. Seizing the opportunity to delve deeper into topics that promoted human well-being, he expounded on the benefits of spiritual growth, healthy lifestyle choices, and the importance of selfless service to others. As the students listened intently, they were not only enlightened but also inspired to integrate these principles into their own lives, fostering a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment in their daily existence."
508,Abnormalities of jatharagni (digestive power) leads to the morbid accumulation of the mala (dosha and bodily wastes) and in turn tend to cause multiple diseases and particularly udara roga. ,"Inefficiencies and imbalances in the digestive power, known as jatharagni, can lead to a host of health issues. When jatharagni is not functioning optimally, the body is unable to properly process and eliminate waste products, leading to their abnormal accumulation. This accumulation of doshas and bodily wastes, or malas, can create a fertile ground for the development of various diseases, with udara roga being one of them. Udara roga is a digestive disorder that can cause significant discomfort and illness, making it crucial to maintain a healthy and balanced jatharagni to prevent its onset."
509,"In the state of impaired jatharagni consumption of unhealthy foods further leads to indigestion and eventually causes accumulation of morbid substances. Thus formed morbidity afflicts the functioning of prana vata, agni as well as apana vata which in turn obliterates the channels tending upwards and downwards. Due to this obliteration of channels, finally the morbid dosha tend to divulge and penetrate the space between the skin and flesh and gets accumulated there. This accumulation leads severe distention of the abdomen and causes serious disease udara roga. Hereafter etiology and clinical symptoms of the same have been narrated. [9-11]","The state of an imbalanced jatharagni, or digestive fire, can lead to significant consequences when unhealthy food is consumed. Instead of being properly digested, these foods can contribute to indigestion, allowing morbid substances to accumulate in the body. This morbidity can then interfere with the functioning of prana vata, agni, and apana vata, three vital forces responsible for various functions in the body. As a result, the channels that carry these forces can become obliterated, causing morbid dosha to penetrate the space between the skin and flesh, leading to severe abdominal distention known as udara roga. The etiology and clinical symptoms of this condition are described in detail, highlighting the importance of proper digestion in maintaining overall health."
510,"Consumption of foods that are excessively hot in property, excessive consumption of salty foods, excessive intake of foods containing solutions of kshara (alkali obtained from ash of herbs), excessive intake of foods that cause burning sensation on digestion, excessive consumption of foods that are sour in taste, consumption of garavisha (intentional application of poison or poison synthesized by combination of nontoxic substances), erroneous dietary management following shodhana treatment, excessive consumption of foods having ruksha (dry) property, intake of viruddha ahara (combination of foods having mutually contradictory properties), consumption of unhealthy foods, emaciation due to splenic enlargement, emaciation due to arshas (mass per rectum), emaciation due to grahani roga (malabsorption), improper  administration of Panchakarma, ignorance of persistent illness without treatment, dryness of the body, withholding the naturally manifesting urges, morbidity of body channels, illness of ama (undigested food), psychological irritation, excessive consumption of foods, obstruction of the ano-rectal canal by the arshas (mass per rectum), impaction of hair within the lumen of the intestines, impaction of hardened stools within the intestines, perforation or rupture of intestines, excessive accumulation of morbidity, indulging in sinful activities,  these causes will lead to development of udara roga and among these more particularly the impairment of jatharagni. [12-15]","The consumption of certain foods and dietary habits can significantly contribute to the development of udara roga, a group of diseases affecting the abdomen according to Ayurvedic medicine. Excessive intake of foods that are extremely hot, salty, alkali-rich from herbal ash, sour, or those causing burning sensations during digestion can all lead to this condition. Additionally, consuming garavisha, or intentionally ingesting poison or poisonous combinations of substances, can also contribute to its onset. Erroneous dietary choices following shodhana treatment and the excessive consumption of dry or contradictory food properties can also increase the risk.

Furthermore, the neglect of persistent illnesses without proper treatment, dryness of the body, and withholding natural urges can also play a role. Morbidity of body channels, ama (undigested food) accumulation, and psychological irritations may also contribute to udara roga development. Physical issues such as emaciation due to splenic enlargement, arshas (mass per rectum), and grahani roga (malabsorption) can also increase the likelihood of developing udara roga. Lastly, improper administration of Panchakarma and indulging in sinful activities can further exacerbate these risks. However, among all these factors, impairment of jatharagni (digestive fire) is considered a significant contributor to udara roga development. Other physical complications such as obstruction or impaction of the ano-rectal canal, intestines, and internal structures may also lead to udara roga."
511,"Loss of appetite, delayed digestion of foods that are sweet, greasy and heavy for digestion, food consumed causing burning sensation, inability to appreciate the digestion and indigestion of the food, intolerance to over eating, slight edema in the feet, constant reduction in the physical strength, breathlessness even on slight exertion, abdominal distension due to accumulation of fecal matter resulting due to dryness or udavarta (abnormal upward course of vata), abdominal pain, fullness of the abdomen, distension of the abdomen or bursting type of abdominal pain at the site where bladder meets the surrounding, distension of the stomach even after small meals, appearance of distended veins and loss of normal skin folds are the premonitory symptoms of udara   roga. [16-19]","Udara Roga, a digestive disorder in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, is characterized by a variety of premonitory symptoms. These signs can serve as important indicators of the onset of the condition, allowing for early intervention and treatment. Initial symptoms may include a loss of appetite and aversion to sweet, greasy, and heavy foods due to difficulties in digestion. Consumed food may cause a burning sensation, and individuals may experience intolerance to overeating. Additionally, physical strength may gradually decrease, breathlessness may occur even with slight exertion, and abdominal distension may be present due to fecal matter accumulation resulting from dryness or abnormal vata movement. Other symptoms such as abdominal pain, fullness, and distension; appearance of distended veins; and loss of normal skin folds may also be observed. Slight edema in the feet can also be a premonitory symptom. It is essential to be aware of these signs to ensure timely treatment and management of Udara Roga."
512,"Morbid dosha by obstructing the channels of sweda (sweat) and udaka (body fluid) and afflicting the prana vata, agni and apana vata causes udara roga. [20]","Udara roga, a digestive system disorder, is caused by the obstruction of the sweat and body fluid channels in the body. This obstruction results in morbid dosha, which in turn affects the prana vata, agni, and apana vata, further exacerbating the condition. The imbalance in these vital bodily functions disrupts the normal functioning of the digestive system, leading to various health issues. It is crucial to address this obstruction to alleviate the symptoms of udara roga, making it essential to maintain a healthy balance in the body's internal systems."
513,"Distension and gurgling sound in the abdomen, edema of hands and feet, impaired digestion, smooth shiny cheeks and emaciation are the common symptoms of udara roga. [21]","Udara roga is a condition that is accompanied by a range of symptoms that can significantly impact a person's quality of life. One of the most common symptoms is distention and gurgling sounds in the abdomen, which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing for those who experience it. Additionally, patients with udara roga may also notice edema in their hands and feet, making it difficult to perform daily activities. Impaired digestion is another common symptom, which can lead to further complications such as malnutrition and weight loss. The physical manifestations of this condition can also include smooth, shiny cheeks, which can be a sign of nutrient deficiencies. Despite these challenges, early diagnosis and treatment of udara roga can help to alleviate symptoms and improve patients' overall health and wellbeing."
514,"Three types of udara caused by each morbid dosha, one type of udara caused by morbidity of all three dosha, plihodara (splenomegaly), baddhodara (enlargement of abdomen due to gastrointestinal obstruction), kshatodara (abdominal enlargement due to intestinal perforation) and udakodara (enlargement of abdomen due to collection of fluid) are the eight types of udara. Listen to the characteristic symptoms each of these types of udara roga. [22].","Udara, a term used in Ayurvedic medicine, refers to abdominal enlargement and can be caused by an imbalance in the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha can cause a specific type of udara. For instance, an imbalance in Vata can lead to a distended abdomen, while Pitta and Kapha can cause abdominal fullness and ascites, respectively. Moreover, a combination of all three doshas can cause splenomegaly or enlargement of the spleen. Other causes of udara include gastrointestinal obstruction (baddhodara), intestinal perforation (kshatodara), and collection of fluids in the abdomen (udakodara). As an article writer, it's essential to understand and highlight the unique symptoms associated with each type of udara roga to help diagnose and treat this condition effectively."
515,"Among the etiological factors of udara roga is intake of dry food articles, consumption of inadequate amount of food, exertion, suppression of naturally manifesting urges, abnormal upward course of vata and weight reducing activities like walking or lifting weight causes vatodara. [23]","Udara roga, a condition that has been discussed extensively in ancient Ayurvedic texts, has several etiological factors that can contribute to its development. According to these texts, consuming dry food articles and not eating enough food can lead to this condition. Additionally, excessive exertion, suppressing natural urges, and engaging in weight reducing activities such as walking or lifting weights can also be causative factors for vatodara, a type of udara roga. Another important factor that can lead to this condition is the abnormal upward course of vata, which can disrupt the balance of the doshas and lead to various health issues. Understanding these etiological factors can help in the prevention and management of udara roga and maintaining overall health and well-being."
516,"Due to the etiological factors [vata]] gets aggravated which assumes abnormal course and reaches the kukshi (lower abdomen), hridaya (chest), basti (pelvis) and gudamarga (rectum). Again the morbid vata further impairs the agni (digestive enzymes) and draws out the kapha. Thus morbid kapha in turn obstructs the morbid vata. Eventually the obstructed vata gets diverged in to the space between the skin and visceral tissues in the abdomen leading to distension of the abdomen and udara roga. [23-24]","The balance of the bodily elements is disrupted when the vata, due to certain etiological factors, becomes aggravated and takes an abnormal course, affecting the lower abdomen, chest, pelvis, and rectum. This morbid vata further impairs the digestive enzymes, allowing kapha to be drawn out and obstructed, leading to a cycle where the obstructed vata is diverted into the space between the skin and visceral tissues in the abdomen. This results in the distension of the abdomen, which is a key symptom of udara roga, a condition that affects the digestive system's overall health and function. (23-24)"
517,"The symptoms of vatodara include distension of abdomen, edema of the hands, legs and scrotum, splitting type of pain in abdomen, undue increase and decrease of abdominal distension, abdominal pain, pain in the sides of the abdomen, abnormal upward course of vata within abdomen, body ache, pain in phalangeal joints, dry cough, emaciation, debility, lack of taste in mouth, indigestion, heaviness in the lower abdomen, obstructed flatus, constipation, retention of the urine, brown or reddish black discoloration of the nails, brown or reddish black discoloration of the conjunctiva, buccal mucosa, dermis, urine and fecal matter; abdominal wall possessing thin, blackish stretch lines and vessels, tympanic note on percussion similar to the sound produced on tapping air filled leather bag or bladder and upward, downward and lateral painful movement of vata with gurgling sound within the abdomen. [25]","Vataodara is a medical condition that primarily affects the digestive system and is characterized by a variety of symptoms. One of the most common symptoms is distension of the abdomen, which can be accompanied by edema in the hands, legs, and scrotum. Patients with vataodara may also experience splitting type pain in the abdomen, as well as abnormal increases or decreases in abdominal distension. Other digestive symptoms can include abdominal pain, pain in the sides of the abdomen, indigestion, heaviness in the lower abdomen, obstructed flatus, constipation, retention of urine, and a dry cough. Additionally, patients may notice brown or reddish black discoloration in the nails, conjunctiva, buccal mucosa, dermis, urine, and fecal matter. The abdominal wall may also appear thin and blackish with visible stretch lines and vessels, and may produce a tympanic note on percussion similar to the sound produced when tapping an air-filled leather bag or bladder. Finally, patients may experience painful movement of vata in various directions within the abdomen, accompanied by gurgling sounds."
518,"Etiological factors of pittodara are excessive consumption of foods having pungent taste ans sour taste, salty foods, foods having ushna (hot) and tikshna (sharply acting) properties, exposure the heat of fire place, exposure to sunshine, consumption of foods that cause burning sensation whilst getting digested, pre-digestion meals and indigestion. [26]","Pittodara, a condition that affects the hair follicles, has specific etiological factors that contribute to its development. Excessive consumption of foods with pungent and sour tastes, along with salty foods, can trigger this condition. Moreover, foods with ushna (hot) and tikshna (sharply acting) properties also play a significant role in its occurrence. External factors such as exposure to heat from fireplaces and sunshine can exacerbate the condition. Additionally, consuming meals that cause burning sensations during digestion, pre-digestion meals, and indigestion can also contribute to the development of pittodara. Understanding these etiological factors is crucial in managing and preventing this condition."
519,"Due to the etiological factors pitta gets aggravated, which assumes abnormal upward course and obstructs the vata and kapha. Further the morbid pitta by suppressing the agni situated in stomach causes pittodara. [27]","Pitta, one of the three doshas in Ayurvedic medicine, is typically associated with heat and digestion. However, when certain etiological factors cause an aggravation of pitta, it can take on an abnormal upward course, leading to obstruction of vata and kapha. This imbalance can result in various health issues, including pittodara. Pittodara is characterized by a disturbance in digestion and is caused by the morbid pitta suppressing the agni, or digestive fire, located in the stomach. This disruption in the balance of the doshas can lead to a range of digestive symptoms and requires careful attention to restore balance and promote overall health."
520,"The symptoms of pittodara are burning sensation, fever, excessive thirst, transient loss of consciousness, diarrhea, giddiness, abnormal pungent taste in mouth, abnormal green or yellowish discoloration of nails, conjunctiva, mouth, dermis, urine and feces, abdominal wall covered with bluish, yellowish, greenish or coppery stretch marks and distended veins, burning sensation of the abdominal wall, abdomen becoming warm, subjective symptoms of smoke emitting from the abdomen, subjective feeling of abdominal warmth as if fire in near place, abdominal sweating, moistening of the abdomen, abdomen appears soft on palpation and the illness rapidly progressing to ascites. [28]","Pittodara, a rare and complex medical condition, is characterized by a unique set of symptoms that affect various parts of the body. The condition is marked by a burning sensation in the abdomen, accompanied by fever and excessive thirst. One may also experience transient loss of consciousness, diarrhea, and giddiness. The symptoms don't end here; the patient may develop abnormal discoloration in nails, conjunctiva, mouth, dermis, urine, and feces due to jaundice, a common complication of pittodara. The abdomen becomes warm to touch, and patients may feel as if there's smoke emitting from their abdomen or a fire burning nearby. Additionally, abdominal sweating, moistening of the abdomen, and stretch marks on the abdominal wall are also observed. These symptoms progress rapidly and can lead to ascites, a serious condition where fluid accumulates in the abdomen. Early diagnosis and medical intervention are crucial for managing this rare and potentially life-threatening condition."
521,"Indulgence in the factors such as lack of physical exercise, day sleep, excessive consumption of sweet, greasy and slimy foods, curds, milk, liquids and meat of wet land animals causes kaphodara. [29]","Kaphodara, a condition that affects the balance of bodily functions, can be traced back to several indulgent behaviors. A sedentary lifestyle that lacks regular exercise can contribute to this imbalance. Additionally, engaging in daytime napping and giving into cravings for sweets, greasy, and slimy foods can also exacerbate the problem. Consuming large amounts of curds, milk, and liquids may also play a role in disrupting the body's equilibrium. Furthermore, consuming meat from wetland animals has been identified as another potential factor that can lead to kaphodara. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced lifestyle and be mindful of these factors to prevent this condition."
522,The etiological factors lead to the morbidity of kapha which obstructs the body channels that include obliteration of the passage of vata. Thus obstructed vata expels the morbid kapha out of the intestines causing distension of the abdomen. [30],"Etiological factors play a significant role in the development of kapha-related ailments, causing blockages in the body's channels. This obstruction prevents the healthy flow of vata, leading to its expulsion from the intestines. In a desperate attempt to rid the body of the excess kapha, vata becomes overactive, resulting in the distension of the abdomen. This fascinating interplay between kapha and vata highlights the complex nature ofTraditional Ayurvedic principles and the importance of maintaining balance within the body."
523,"The symptoms of kaphodara are heaviness of the body, lack of taste in the mouth, indigestion, body ache, numbness, edema of the hands, feet, scrotum and thighs, nausea due to morbid dosha located in the chest, sleepiness, cough, dyspnea, whitish discoloration of nails, conjunctiva, mouth, skin, urine and feces, abdominal wall covered with whitish stretch marks, whitish distended veins, subjective feeling of heaviness and stillness of the abdomen, unwavering abdomen with hardness of the abdomen. [31]","Kaphodara is a condition that is accompanied by a range of symptoms that primarily affect the overall physical health and appearance of an individual. Those suffering from this condition often experience a heavy feeling in their bodies, along with a noticeable lack of taste in their mouths. Indigestion and body aches are also common, accompanied by numbness and edema in various parts of the body, including the hands, feet, scrotum, and thighs. Nausea and sleepiness are also prevalent due to the accumulation of morbid dosha in the chest. Other symptoms include a persistent cough, dyspnea or shortness of breath, and whitish discoloration of various bodily features such as nails, conjunctiva, mouth, skin, urine, and feces. Moreover, those with Kaphodara may notice whitish stretch marks on their abdominal walls and distended veins, along with a subjective feeling of heaviness and stillness in the abdomen. The abdomen itself may appear unwavering and hard to the touch, making this condition difficult to ignore."
524,"The etiological factors such as person with impaired agni (digestive power) indulging in unhealthy food habits and consuming foods that are inadequately cooked, taking food articles having mutually contradictory properties, eating foods that are heavy for digestion, consumption of food adulterated with dust, hair, feces, urine, bone and nails which is offered by a wicked lady and slow poisoning by the intake of dushivisha (chronic poisoning) cause sannipatodara. [32]","Sannipatodara is a condition that results from various etiological factors, according to ancient health practices. One such factor is the consumption of food by individuals with impaired agni (digestive power) who indulge in unhealthy food habits. Inadequately cooked food, as well as food articles with mutually contradictory properties, can also contribute to this condition. Moreover, consuming food that is heavy and difficult to digest, or that is tainted with impurities like dust, hair, feces, urine, bone, and nails, can increase the risk of developing sannipatodara. Notably, this condition can also result from slow poisoning by the intake of chronic poisoning, known as dushivisha, or from food offered by a wicked lady. Understanding these various causes can help inform preventative measures and treatment options for those affected by sannipatodara."
525,"Exposure to the etiological factors lead to morbidity of all three dosha, which gradually accumulates in the abdomen causing sannipatodara. [33]","Etiological factors, when encountered, can trigger imbalances in the three fundamental bodily energies, or doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. If left untreated, these imbalances can progressively accumulate and manifest as a severe form of digestive disorder known as sannipatodara in Ayurvedic medicine. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of all three doshas in the abdomen and typically arises from prolonged exposure to harmful factors that disrupt the body's equilibrium. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and address these etiological factors promptly to prevent more severe health complications associated with sannipatodara."
526,"The symptoms of sannipatodara are manifestation of symptoms pathognomonic of all three dosha, variegated abnormal coloration of nails and other body parts pathognomonic of all three dosha and appearance of stretch marks and veins having variegated color pathognomonic of morbidity of all three dosha. This illness is regarded as sannipatodara. [34]","Sannipatodara is a unique medical condition that exhibits symptoms associated with the imbalance of all three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the human body. This condition is characterized by the manifestation of abnormal colorations in nails and other body parts, a clear indication of the involvement of all three doshas. Additionally, the appearance of stretch marks and veins with variegated colors is another significant symptom that points towards the morbidity of all three doshas. Overall, Sannipatodara is a complex medical condition that requires careful diagnosis and treatment, considering its multi-dosha involvement and the variety of symptoms it presents."
527,"The plihodara is caused by activities like travelling excessively in vibrating vehicle, heavy exercises that involve violent jerky movements of the body and are done immediately after the meals, excessive sex, lifting heavy objects, indulging in heavy walking, excessive vomiting and emaciation due to chronic illness [35].","The plihodara condition is a result of various physical activities and behaviors that put excessive pressure on the body, particularly after meals. These actions include excessive traveling in vibrating vehicles, engaging in rigorous exercises with violent jerking movements immediately after eating, and having excessive sex. Additionally, lifting heavy objects, indulging in heavy walking, and inducing excessive vomiting can also contribute to this condition. Furthermore, plihodara can arise from emaciation due to chronic illness, highlighting the wide range of factors that can cause this ailment."
528,"Afflicted by the jerky movements of the body etc, the spleen located in the left side(flank or left hypochondriac region) enlarges and descends to cause enlargement of the abdomen; or else, a variety of dietary factors leading to increment and morbidity of rasa, rakta etc. which in turn causes enlargement of the spleen. Enlarged spleen distends the abdomen causing plihodara [36].","The spleen, a vital organ situated in the left flank or hypochondriac region of the body, can become afflicted, leading to involuntary jerking movements and a subsequent enlargement. This enlargement may also occur due to a range of dietary factors that contribute to an increase and corruption of rasa and rakta, which ultimately lead to a swelling of the spleen. When the spleen expands, it can cause plihodara, a condition where the abdomen becomes distended, negatively impacting an individual's quality of life. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet and undergo regular medical check-ups to ensure the proper functioning of the spleen and overall health."
529,"Baddhodara is caused by the obliteration of the passage of stools due to consumption of the food admixed with feathers of birds or human hair, udavarta (reversed course of vata in abdomen), due to arshas (ano-rectal mass lesion) and intussusception of the intestines [39].","Baddhodara, a condition that affects the normal passage of stools, has been linked to several factors, according to a study cited in [39]. The consumption of food contaminated with bird feathers or human hair can lead to the obliteration of the stool passage, causing discomfort and difficulty in bowel movements. Additionally, udavarta, or the reversed course of vata in the abdomen, can also contribute to the development of Baddhodara. Furthermore, anorectal mass lesions (arshas) and intussusception of the intestines have been identified as potential causes of this condition. These factors can cause obstruction in the intestines, leading to painful and difficult bowel movements associated with Baddhodara."
530,Obliteration of the passage of colon leads to morbidity of apana vata which in turn impairs the functioning of the agni as well as obstructs the excretion of stools and obliterates the movement of pitta and kapha. Eventually the patient suffers from the baddhagudodara [40].,"The obliteration of the passage of colon can have significant consequences on an individual's health, according to Ayurvedic principles. This obstruction can lead to morbidity of apana vata, a type of energy responsible for elimination and downward movement in the body. As a result, the functioning of agni, or digestive fire, can be impaired, affecting the body's ability to digest and process food properly. Moreover, the excretion of stools may become obstructed, and the movement of pitta and kapha, the energies responsible for metabolism and lubrication, may be obliterated. Ultimately, these complications can lead to a serious condition known as baddhagudodara, which can cause great discomfort and distress for the patient."
531,"Consumption of food contaminated with sand particles, straw, pieces of wood, bone and thorn, or else yawing with stretching of the body as well as excessive intake of food causes injury to intestine lead to chhidrodara [42].","The consumption of food tainted with foreign particles such as sand, straw, small pieces of wood, bone, and thorn can wreak havoc on one's health, leading to a condition known as chhidrodara [42]. This issue can also arise from habits such as yawning while stretching the body, which can potentially harm the intestines. Additionally, excessive food intake has been identified as another cause of chhidrodara, making it crucial to maintain a balanced diet and be mindful of one's eating habits to prevent this condition from developing."
532,"Contaminated food causes perforation of the intestines, which undergoes suppuration. Or else the suppuration of the intestines may happen due to yawing or excessive food which in turn leads to perforation. Perforation of the intestines further causes leaking out of the chyle from the intestines, which tends to move into the dependent parts of the abdomen filling the intestinal and rectal parts. Eventually the accumulation of the fluids in the lower abdomen manifests in chhidrodara [43].","The contamination of food can have serious consequences on an individual's health, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions such as chhidrodara. When contaminated food is consumed, it can cause the intestines to become perforated and suppurated. This perforation may also occur due to excessive eating or prolonged yawing that creates a hole in the intestinal wall. As a result, chyle from the intestines leaks out and moves into the dependent parts of the abdomen, filling up both the intestinal and rectal areas. This accumulation of fluids in the lower abdomen ultimately manifests as chhidrodara, a condition that requires immediate medical attention."
533,"Excessive consumption of water on occasions like oral medication with medicated ghee, impaired state of agni, debility and emaciation causes destruction of digestive power and vitiation of vata situated at kloma. [45]. ","The excessive consumption of water during certain activities, such as taking oral medication with medicated ghee, can have detrimental effects on the body, particularly when the digestive fire (agni) is already impaired or in a weakened state (debility and emaciation). This excess intake can lead to the destruction of the digestive power, causing a disturbance in the functioning of vata situated in the kloma (a term used in Ayurveda to refer to the small intestine). This disruption can further lead to various health issues and imbalances in the body. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balance in water intake and be mindful of one's digestive health."
534,These vitiated factors obliterate udaka-vaha-srotas. Thus obliterated kapha mixed water further increases the fluid contents which by disloging from its site and accumulating in abdomen produce jalodara [46].,"The delicate balance of the body's systems can be disrupted by the presence of certain damaging factors, leading to the obstruction of the udaka-vaha-srotas, or water metabolism pathway. This obstruction can cause an excess buildup of kapha-infused water, which further increases the body's fluid levels. When this water is dislodged from its proper site and accumulates in the abdomen, it can result in the development of jalodara, or ascites, a serious medical condition characterized by abnormal fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity. It is important to address the underlying causes of these vitiating factors in order to prevent further complications and restore proper health and balance to the body."
535,"Among the list of vatodara, pittodara, kaphodara, plihodara, sannipatodara and jalodara (ascites); the later ones are more and more difficult to cure. After a fortnight the baddhodara (enlargement of abdomen due to gastrointestinal obstruction) and udara that presents with accumulation of fluid are incurable. Mostly chhidrodara (enlargement of abdomen due to intestinal perforation) is fatal. The treatment should be avoided in patients of udara presenting with peri-orbital edema, distorted genitalia, moistening and thinning of the skin, severe reduction in the physical strength, severe depletion in the blood, severe wasting of the body flesh and severe impairment in the agni.  ","In the hierarchy of abdominal ailments including vatodara, pittodara, kaphodara, plihodara, sannipatodara, and jalodara (ascites), the latter conditions pose increasingly challenging treatment prospects. With a grim prognosis, baddhodara and udara, characterized by fluid accumulation in the abdomen, become increasingly incurable after a two-week period. Among these, chhidrodara, often caused by intestinal perforation, is frequently fatal. It is advised to refrain from treating udara patients who exhibit peri-orbital edema, distorted genitalia, moist and thinning skin, severe reduction in physical strength, significant blood depletion, extensive bodily wasting, and severely impaired agni (digestive fire)."
536,"The development of symptoms like edema involving all vital parts, breathlessness, hiccough, tastelessness in the mouth, transient loss of consciousness, vomiting and diarrhea kills the patients of udara roga.  ","The deadly disease known as udara roga has been known to take a toll on patients with its severe symptoms. One of the most alarming signs of this illness is the development of edema, which affects all vital parts of the body. Additionally, patients experience severe breathlessness, persistent hiccoughs, and a complete loss of taste in their mouths. Other distressing symptoms include transient losses of consciousness, recurring vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms ultimately contribute to the fatal outcome of udara roga, making it a formidable and dangerous disease."
537,"The udara is difficult to cure from the very onset itself but if the patient is physically strong, in state of ajatodaka (initial phase of distension of abdomen with slight fluid accumulation) and the udara of recent onset can be managed only with energetic treatment [50-54].","The udara disease presents a formidable challenge for medical professionals right from the outset, but if the patient is fortunate enough to possess a robust physical constitution and is in the initial phase of abdominal distension with minimal fluid accumulation (ajatodaka), then there is a glimmer of hope. In such cases, the recent onset of udara may be effectively managed through vigorous and energetic treatment regimens, which can help to alleviate symptoms and potentially reverse the course of the disease. However, it is crucial to note that this window of opportunity may only be open for a brief period, and prompt and aggressive intervention is necessary to maximize the chances of a successful outcome."
538,"State of ajatodaka (initial phase of distension of abdomen without fluid accumulation) of the udara is presents with symptoms such as pink coloration of distended abdomen, increased gurgling sound, comparatively less heaviness of the abdomen, persistent gurgling sound, abdomen  covered with network of distended veins, the flatus frequently generates urges to pass with distention of the umbilical region and then fades away with of farting, pain in the cardiac region, umbilical region, groin, sacral region and anal part, passing of flatus with loud sound, less severe impairment of digestion, tastelessness in the mouth, reduced urination and constipation. This state of ajatodaka should be treated with the due consideration of degree of morbidity of dosha as well as time [55-58].","In the initial phase of abdominal distension, known as ajatodaka, the abdomen may take on a pink hue and become covered in a network of distended veins. Other symptoms include increased gurgling sounds, less heaviness in the abdomen, and intermittent urges to pass gas accompanied by a loud sound. The patient may also experience pain in the cardiac, umbilical, groin, sacral, and anal regions, as well as tastelessness in the mouth, reduced urination, and constipation. The state of ajatodaka requires careful medical treatment, taking into account the degree of dosha morbidity and the appropriate time for intervention. (55-58)"
539,"Patient of vatodara who is physically strong should be initially treated with unctuous medications. Then after the snehana is completed, abhyanga (unctuous massage) and sweda (sudation) is done. ","In the healthcare landscape of Vadodara, a unique approach is taken when treating physically robust patients. The therapy regimen begins with the administration of unctuous medications, harnessing their strengthening properties to prepare the body for further treatment. Once this initial phase, known as Snehana, is completed, the process moves on to Abhyanga - an invigorating unctuous massage that helps to stimulate the body's internal systems. This is then followed by Sweda, a carefully controlled process of sudation that promotes detoxification, relaxation, and overall wellbeing. This holistic approach ensures that patients not only receive treatment for their ailments but also experience a rejuvenation of their physical strength and vitality."
540,Then the sneha virechana (purgation with unctuous purgatives) should be given. After elimination of dosha with shodhana (purification procedure) the abdomen should be tightly bandaged so that no space is left in the abdomen for the morbid vata to cause distension of the abdomen again [59-60].,"In the ancient medical practice of Ayurveda, the process of cleansing and purification known as shodhana plays a crucial role in the treatment of various ailments. Specifically, in addressing issues related to excess Vata, a particular method known as Sneha Virechana is employed. This technique involves administering unctuous purgatives to eliminate the excess Dosha from the system. Once this purification procedure is complete, it is essential to carefully bandage the abdomen, ensuring that no space is left for morbid Vata to accumulate and cause further distention. This meticulous attention to detail is what sets Ayurveda apart, as practitioners strive to promote holistic wellness and balance within the body."
541,"Udara is caused due to the obliteration of the body channels leading to accumulation of morbid dosha. Hence udara should be treated by regular virechana (therapeutic purgation). After the purgation, with an intention to improve the physical strength and to relieve the strain of purgation, the patient should be given milk. ","Udara, a condition characterized by the accumulation of morbid dosha due to the obstruction of bodily channels, requires specific treatment methods to ensure proper recovery. The primary approach to managing udara involves regular virechana, or therapeutic purgation, which aids in eliminating excess doshas from the system. Post-purgation, rejuvenating measures must be taken to restore physical strength and alleviate any residual strain from the treatment process. A nourishing and soothing remedy like milk is often recommended, providing both sustenance and relief for the patient undergoing udara treatment."
542,"Gradually as the patient regains strength by the intake of milk, his functioning of the agni should be improved by giving yusha (cereal soup) or meat soup added with little salt [61-62].","Once a patient begins to regain their strength through the consumption of milk, it is essential to further improve their digestive fire or ""agni."" This can be achieved by incorporating warm and nourishing foods into their diet, such as yusha or cereal soup and meat soups, which are easy to digest and assimilate. Adding a little salt to these dishes can help enhance the flavor and make them more appealing to the patient. By consuming these nutritious and easily digestible foods, the patient's overall health and vitality can be gradually restored, allowing them to fully recover from their illness."
543,"If the patient has udavarta (reversed course of vata in the abdomen), sphurana (fasciculation), akshepa (involuntary movements), pain in the joints, bone, sides of the abdomen, back and sacral region; then again after performing oleation and sudation asthapana basti (decoction enema) is given [63].","In the context of addressing specific symptoms in Ayurvedic medicine, particular attention is paid to udavarta, a reversed course of vata in the abdomen. When a patient presents with additional symptoms such as fasciculation, involuntary movements, pain in the joints, bones, and various regions of the abdomen and back, a specific treatment plan is prescribed. This includes oleation and sudation, or the application of oil and sweating, followed by asthapana basti, a decoction enema. The intention behind this method is to provide relief and restore balance to the affected areas and systems within the body, ultimately guiding the patient back towards optimal health and wellness."
544,If the patient has strong digestive power and suffers from obstructed bowel movement and flatus as well as with dryness of the body; then he should be treated by anuvasana basti (oily enema) [64],"The treatment of a patient's health concerns is a delicate matter that requires careful consideration of several factors, including their digestive power. For those who experience obstructed bowel movements, excessive flatulence, and dryness in their body, anuvasana basti, or oily enema, is recommended.

This procedure involves the use of a decoction, prepared from a combination of ten herbs, including Bilva, Agnimantha, Shyonaka, Kashmari, Patala, Shalaparni, Prishniparni, Brihati, Kantakari, and Gokshura. This potent concoction is then combined with powerful purgatives and administered to patients, helping to eliminate toxins and restore balance to the body. The Dashamula Niruha Basti is a crucial component of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, reflecting the holistic approach to healthcare that has been practiced for centuries."
546,Anuvasana basti (oily enema) should be given with eranda taila (castor oil) or tila taila (sesame oil) processed with sour and anti vata drugs [65].,"Anuvasana Basti, also known as an oily enema, is a crucial aspect of Ayurvedic therapy that uses medicated oils to cleanse and rejuvenate the body. Two popular oils used in this practice are eranda taila, or castor oil, and tila taila, or sesame oil. These oils are processed with sour and anti-vata drugs, which help to combat imbalances in the vata dosha, or energy, in the body. By using these specific oils and drugs, Anuvasana Basti can promote overall health and well-being in individuals who receive this treatment."
547,"The patient who is debilitated, aged, children, having delicate constitution, minimal morbidity of dosha and dominant vitiation of vata and unfit for virechana karma (therapeutic purgation) should be treated by palliative (shamana) measures. ","When treating a patient who is debilitated, advanced in age, young, or of delicate constitution, with minimal morbidity of dosha and a dominant vitiation of vata, it is recommended to opt for palliative measures over therapeutic purgation, known as virechana karma. This approach is particularly suitable for those who are unfit to undergo the rigors of purgation therapy, allowing for a more gentle and supportive path to healing and recovery. By focusing on shamana treatments that aim to alleviate symptoms, reduce discomfort, and promote overall well-being, healthcare practitioners can provide effective care tailored to the unique needs of these vulnerable individuals."
548,"Shamana treatment comprises use of medicated ghee, meat soup, rice, oil massage and milk. Such patients may also be given anuvasana basti (oily enema).[66-67]","Shamana treatment is a traditional Indian medical approach that focuses on alleviating symptoms and providing immediate relief to the patient. This therapy is commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine and includes the use of various natural materials. Medicated ghee, or clarified butter, is often used in shamana treatment to soothe and nourish the body. Meat soups and rice are also given to provide strength and energy to the patient. Additionally, oil massages can be used to improve circulation and reduce inflammation. In some cases, anuvasana basti, or oily enema, may also be administered to help cleanse and detoxify the body. Finally, milk is often used as a nourishing and soothing drink to help the patient regain their strength. Overall, shamana treatment aims to provide holistic care and support to the patient through the use of natural and wholesome materials."
549,Physically strong patients suffering from pittodara should be treated by virechana karma (therapeutic purgation) at the outset [68].,"Pittodara, a condition characterized by a protrusion of the rectum, can be a challenging ailment to treat, particularly in patients who are physically robust. According to Ayurvedic medical traditions, it is recommended that such patients undergo virechana karma, or therapeutic purgation, as the initial course of treatment [68]. This practice involves the administration of herbal medicines that induce bowel movements, helping to cleanse the body and alleviate the symptoms of pittodara. By starting with this foundational treatment, practitioners aim to create a clean slate for further therapies and interventions, thereby increasing the chances of a successful recovery for the patient."
550,"If the patient of pittodara is physically weak then he should be treated by purification by adapting kshirabasti (decoction enema consisting of milk as predominant ingredient). By this treatment when the patient regains physical strength, and improved digestive power, once again the patient should be treated by virechana (therapeutic purgation) [68-69]","In the management of Pittodara, or chronic enlargement of the liver, it is crucial to address the patient's physical weakness through a process of purification known as Kshirabasti. This therapy, which primarily utilizes a milk-based decoction enema, not only fortifies the patient's physical strength but also enhances their digestive capabilities. Once the individual has regained their strength and digestive power has improved, the subsequent course of treatment should involve Virechana, a therapeutic purgation, for continued care and recovery. (Sutra Stantra 68-69)"
551,"Virechana be performed by administering paste of trivrita (Operculina turpethum) with milk; decoction of urubuka (Ricinus communis), decoction of satala (Euphorbia Tirucalli) and trayamana (Gentiana kurrhoa) or decoction of aragvadha (Cassia fistula). Again, if the dominance of kapha is present then in the above preparation cow’s urine may be added. If the dominance of vata is present, then in the above medicines for virechana (therapeutic purgation) medicated ghee prepared with bitter herbs should be given [69-70]","According to the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, virechana or therapeutic purgation is a crucial detoxification procedure that is performed to eliminate excess doshas or humors from the body. The specific substances used in this procedure may vary depending on the individual's specific needs and dosha imbalances. If a person has a dominance of kapha, cow's urine may be added to the preparation, which includes a paste of trivrita, decoctions of urubuka, satala, and trayamana, or decoction of aragvadha. On the other hand, if vata is dominant, medicated ghee prepared with bitter herbs is given prior to the purgation. The use of these specific substances and preparations highlights the personalized and holistic approach of Ayurvedic medicine in treating illnesses and maintaining overall health and well-being."
552,"Oral treatment with milk, basti karma (medicated enema) and virechana (therapeutic purgation) should be repeated in pittodara; by this patient is gradually stabilized and the illness gets cured [71].","In the management of Pittodara, a condition characterized by an imbalance in the Pitta dosha, oral treatments involving milk along with therapies such as Basti Karma (medicated enema) and Virechana (therapeutic purgation) play a pivotal role. These practices, when repeated, gradually help in stabilizing the patient's condition and ultimately lead to the cure of this ailment. This holistic approach, deeply rooted in Ayurvedic principles, emphasizes on the importance of cleansing and rebalancing the body's doshas for a comprehensive recovery."
553,"In patients suffering from kaphodara, shodhana (eliminative therapy) is done after preparing with oleation and sudation. In samsarjana krama (gradual diet schedule) pungent, kshara and anti-kapha diet is prescribed [72].","In the management of a medical condition known as kaphodara in Ayurvedic medicine, the treatment plan includes a phase of shodhana, or eliminative therapy, following a period of oleation and sudation. This process helps to remove toxins and restore balance within the body. Following this, a specific dietary regimen called samsarjana krama is implemented. This diet primarily consists of pungent, kshara, and anti-kapha foods, all of which help to counteract the excess kapha dosha and promote overall well-being and health in the patient's body."
554,"Shamana (palliative) treatment is done in kaphodara by oral intake of gomutra (cow’s urine), arishta (fermented decoctions), drug powder, ayaskriti (medically processed iron) and sesame oil added with kshara (alkali obtained from ash of herbs) [73].","In the ancient Indian medical practice known as Kaphodara, shamana (palliative) treatment is carried out using a variety of natural and herbal remedies. One such remedy involves the oral intake of gomutra, or cow's urine, which is believed to have healing properties and is used to help restore balance to the body. Additionally, patients may be given arishta, which are fermented decoctions made from various herbs and plants. Drug powder, obtained from medicinal plants, is also used to treat specific ailments and promote overall wellness. Another key component of shamana treatment in Kaphodara is ayaskriti, which involves the processing of iron with herbs and medicinal plants to create a powerful remedy. Finally, sesame oil mixed with kshara, an alkali obtained from the ash of herbs, is often applied topically to treat skin conditions and promote healing."
555,Sannipatodara should be treated by the combination of treatment mentioned for doshaja udara depending upon the requirement [74]. If the patient presents with all the complications of udara then the physician should avoid treating such patients considering it as pratyakhyeya (near death) [74].,"In managing the medical condition of Sannipatodara, it is recommended to utilize a treatment approach that is tailored to the specific complications of doshaja udara that a patient may present with. This individualized treatment plan should follow the guidelines set forth for doshaja udara, with careful consideration given to the unique needs and symptoms of each patient. However, in cases where a patient exhibits all of the severe complications associated with udara, physicians are advised to exercise caution and consider the situation to be a pratyakhyeya, or near-death, scenario, and potentially avoid treating such individuals. Proper evaluation and judgement are crucial in determining the most appropriate course of action for patients with complex and serious medical conditions like Sannipatodara and doshaja udara."
556,"Association of symptoms like udavarta (anti peristalsis), abdominal pain and flatulence indicate dominance of vata in the plihodara. Symptoms like burning sensation, delirious state, excessive thirst and fever suggests dominance of pitta.  ","The Indian science of Ayurveda identifies two dominant doshas, or energies, that can contribute to plihodara, or enlarged abdomen: vata and pitta. When a patient experiences udavarta (anti peristalsis), abdominal pain, and excessive gas, it is indicative of an excess of vata in the plihodara. Conversely, the dominance of pitta is signaled by a set of different symptoms, such as a burning sensation in the abdomen, a delirious state, excessive thirst, and high fever. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for tailoring treatment plans to the individual's needs, according to the principles of Ayurveda."
557,"Predominance of kapha is judged by the symptoms like heaviness, lack of taste in the mouth and hardness of the abdomen. Presence of symptoms indicative of morbidity of rakta as mentioned in Vidhishonitiya Adhyaya point towards the dominance of morbid rakta in the pathogenesis of plihodara. Hence, plihodara should be treated according to the dominance of dosha involved [75-76].","The predominance of kapha dosha in an individual can be identified through a set of distinct symptoms, including feelings of heaviness, an absence of taste in the mouth, and a hardened abdomen. Moreover, the manifestation of symptoms indicative of impure blood (rakta), as described in the Vidhishonitiya Adhyaya, suggests the prevalence of morbid rakta during the onset of plihodara. Consequently, it becomes crucial to tailor the treatment of plihodara based on the specific dosha that holds dominance during its pathogenesis, as stated in the text [75-76]. This individualized approach allows for a more effective and targeted treatment strategy, considering the unique imbalances present in each person's bodily constitution."
558,"With the due analysis of the pathogenesis, plihodara should be treated by measures like oral medication of sneha (medicated unctuous substance), sudation, virechana (therapeutic purgation), niruha (decoction enema) and anuvasana basti (oil enema) and raktamokshana (blood-letting) by sectioning the vein located in the left arm [77].","After careful examination of the underlying pathology of plihodara, it has been determined that an effective treatment plan includes the administration of oral medication in the form of sneha, a medicated unctuous substance, to help alleviate symptoms. Additionally, sudation, virechana, and niruha basti, which involve therapeutic purgation and enema treatments, are recommended to help eliminate excess doshas from the body. Furthermore, both anuvasana basti and raktamokshana through sectioning the vein in the left arm have been found to provide significant relief in managing this condition. This holistic approach to treatment aims to restore balance and promote overall health and wellbeing for those suffering from plihodara."
559,"Patient of plihodara is treated by oral medication of shatpala ghrita, pippali (Piper longum), combination of molasses and haritaki (Emblica officinalis), kshara (alkali obtained from ash of herbs) or arishta (fermented decoctions)[78]","In the treatment of Plihodara, an Ayurvedic disorder, various oral medications are administered to manage its symptoms and address its underlying causes. One such medication is Shatapala Ghrita, a traditional Ayurvedic formula made from hundred varieties of palm fruits. Additionally, Piper longum or Pippali, a potent Ayurvedic herb known for its bioactive properties, is often used in the treatment. Another effective remedy is a combination of molasses and Emblica officinalis or Haritaki, which aids in digestion and detoxification. Alkali obtained from the ash of herbs, known as Kshara, is also used in the treatment. Furthermore, patients may be prescribed Arishta, fermented decoctions that help in balancing the doshas and improving overall health. These medications, when used in combination and under the guidance of a skilled Ayurvedic practitioner, can provide effective relief from Plihodara and promote overall well-being."

This concoction, when consumed and digested, is believed to cure ailments such as kamala or jaundice, gulma or abdominal lumps, prameha or frequent turbid urination, arsha or masses in the rectum, and plihodara. Additionally, it is used to treat various types of udara roga or abdominal diseases and krimi or worm infestations. Following this regimen, the patient is then encouraged to consume meat soup of dry land animals as part of their meals, further aiding in the recovery process."
564,"Twenty five pala (1200g) of bark of rohitaka (Tecomella Undulate) and two prastha (1536g) of kola (jujube) are added in eight times water and boiled to get the decoction.

Oral medication with this medicated ghee will immediately cure plihodara, gulma (abdominal lump), udara roga, dyspnea, krimi (worm infestation), anemia and jaundice [83-85].","The preparation of this ancient medicinal concoction begins with the addition of twenty-five palas of rohitaka bark and two prasthas of kolas to a pot filled with eight times water, which is then boiled to create a decoction. To this, a paste made from equal quantities of pippali fruit, chavya fruit, chitraka root, nagara rhizome, and rohitaka bark, along with a smaller dose of the same ingredients, is combined. This mixture is then blended with a substantial amount of cow's ghee, and the entire concoction is boiled again to produce a medicated ghee. According to Ayurvedic texts, consuming this medicated ghee is believed to provide immediate relief from a range of ailments, including abdominal lump, dyspnea, worm infestation, anemia, jaundice, and plihodara, a condition characterized by an enlarged abdomen due to fluid accumulation or fat deposits."
565,The vata and kapha dominated plihodara should be treated by agnikarma (cauterization)[86].,"For individuals who exhibit a dominance of Vata and Kapha doshas, characterized by an accumulation of water and earth elements, leading to a condition known as plihodara, Agnikarma or cauterization is often recommended as a treatment modality in Ayurvedic medicine. This ancient practice involves the use of heat or fire to cauterize affected areas, promoting healing and reducing the symptoms associated with this condition. By carefully controlling the application of heat, Agnikarma aids in eliminating excess doshas, thereby restoring balance to the body and alleviating discomfort for those experiencing plihodara. This traditional approach, deeply rooted in Ayurvedic wisdom, offers a unique and effective solution for managing doshic imbalances and their resulting health concerns."

Patient is asked to take yusha (cereal soup) or meat soup processed with dipaniya (herbs augmenting the digestive power) drugs and light food. Since the etiology and symptomatology of plihodara (splenomegaly) and yakritodara (hepatomegaly) are same, so all the treatment mentioned for plihodara should be adopted in yakritodara [87-88].","In the treatment of Plihodara, where the dominant dosha is Pitta, ancient Ayurvedic texts recommend a variety of methods to restore balance and promote healing. Central to this approach is the oral administration of ghee that has been medicated with potent rejuvenative herbs such as Jeevaka, Rishbhaka, Meda, Mahameda, Kakoli, Kshirakakoli, Riddhi, and Vriddhi. In addition to this, alkali decoction enemas (kshara basti), blood-letting (raktavaseka), and purification measures (shodhana) are employed to eliminate toxins and restore balance to the system.

622,"If patient suffering from udara does not respond to usual treatment due to morbidity of three dosha, then the physician should inform the critical state to the relative of the patient and start treating with venom of cobra after obtaining consent from the patients friends, spouse, brahmins, king as well as teacher. The physician should win the confidence of these people after clearly stating that the patient will not survive if the treatment with venom is not made, and patient may survive if this treatment is done. After obtaining the consent, the physician should mix the venom in food and drink and administer it to the patient.  ","In situations where a patient with udara fails to respond to conventional treatments due to the advanced stage of the disease, affecting the balance of all three doshas, medical practitioners are faced with a challenging decision. They must consider the administration of cobra venom as a last resort, only after obtaining consent from various authoritative figures in the patient's life. Winning the trust and support of the relatives, spouse, brahmins, king, and teacher is crucial before proceeding with such a drastic measure. It is essential to clearly communicate the gravity of the situation and the potential benefits and risks involved in using cobra venom as a treatment option. Once consent is granted, the venom should be carefully administered through food or drink under strict medical supervision. This unconventional approach underscores the importance of exploring all possible options in critical medical cases and demonstrates the ethical considerations required when making life or death decisions in medical practice."
623,"Alternatively the angry serpent is made to release the venom while biting the fruit. Patient is allowed to consume this venomous fruit after proper analysis by the physician. This treatment immediately liquefies the infiltrating displaced morbid dosha by virtue of its pramathi (clearing the channels adhered with dosha) property and eliminates from the body.

This food may be served with or without steaming and during this food rice is avoided. This regimen should be continued for one month. During this course if the patient is thirsty then the juice extracted from these leafy vegetables should be given to the patient. By this method once in one month all the morbid dosha is cleared from the body and the patient is advised to drink milk to improve the physical strength [175-184]","In this unique treatment approach, the angry serpent's venom, when released and infused into a fruit, becomes a potent catalyst for healing.

Following this, the patient undergoes cold water parishechana, a process involving the pouring of medicated liquids onto specific body parts. Depending on the patient's strength, they are then given milk or yavāgu (rice gruel). A special diet regimen is implemented, consisting of leafy vegetable-based food, excluding amla, lavana, and sneha.

624,"Surgical intervention should be done by an expert surgeon. A proper incision is made on the left side of the abdomen about fpur figure (7.8cm) below the umbilicus by an efficient surgeon. From this incision intestinal loops are drawn out and carefully looked for foreign substances causing chidrodara or baddhodara. Ghee is applied on the affected loop of the intestines. Then the foreign substances like hair and others are then removed from the intestinal loop. Any torsion or intussusception of the loops of intestines if present is opened. By the surgical procedure if large rend happens in the intestines then edges of rend is anchored by making the small ants to bite and hold the edges together. Once the ants properly anchor the opposing edges of rend, the body of the ants is separated and thrown. Intestinal loops are then properly inserted into the abdomen and the incised area is sutured. Then wound management is done [184-188].","The delicacy of a surgical intervention for chidrodara or baddhodara requires the expertise of a skilled surgeon. The procedure begins with a precise incision, four fingers' breadth (7.8cm) below the umbilicus on the left side of the abdomen. Once the intestinal loops are drawn out, the surgeon meticulously inspects them for any foreign substances. If found, ghee is applied to the affected loop, and the foreign matter, such as hair, is carefully removed. In case of any torsion or intussusception of the intestinal loops, they are carefully untangled and set right. If a large rent is found in the intestines during the surgery, it is managed by using ants to anchor the edges together, allowing for a secure closure once separated from their bodies. After ensuring the proper reinsertion of the intestinal loops, the incised area is sutured, and wound management is carried out to complete the procedure.[184-188]."
625,"In all conditions of udara with accumulation of fluid, the fluid should be aspirated by inserting a cannula into the abdomen just below the umbilicus on the left side. While aspirating, compress the abdomen and after the aspiration the abdomen is tightly wrapped with a cloth.

After the removal of the fluid patient is treated with langhana (reducing regimen) and is given peya (liquid rice gruel) with little or no addition of sneha (dietary fat) and salt. After this the patient is kept on only milk diet for six months. For another three months patient is allowed to take peya (liquid rice gruel) along with milk. Following this for another three months the patients is given rice prepared with shyāmaka (Echinochloa frumentacea) or koradusha (Paspalum scorbiculatum) added with milk. This light diet should be without salt altogether. By managing the patient in this manner for one year one can get cured of jalodara [189-192]","In cases where the abdomen has accumulated fluids due to various conditions of udara, it is recommended to aspirate the fluid by inserting a cannula below the left side of the umbilicus. During the process, it is important to apply pressure to the abdomen to ensure proper drainage. Once the fluid has been removed, the area should be tightly wrapped to prevent any further buildup. This method should also be applied in instances where reduction of the abdomen is achieved through other methods such as niruha basti and virechana. After the removal of fluid, the patient must follow a reducing regimen, which includes consuming peya with little or no sneha and salt for an extended period of time. The patient's diet should then gradually progress from milk only to milk and peya, and eventually to rice prepared with shyāmaka or koradusha and milk, all without salt.

Habitual intake of astringent, pungent, bitter, ununctuous, cold and light food; Habitual intake of pramitashana ( food measured in extremely small quantities), intake of less quantity of food, intake of excess alcoholic drinks and indulgence in sexual acts. Fasting, living in cold country and cold season, physical exercise, grief and exposure to sun and wind. [12-13]","Vataja arsha, a medical condition originating from the aggravation of vata dosha in the body, has specific causes that contribute to its onset. These causes primarily involve the habitual consumption of certain types of food and drink, as well as exposure to certain environmental factors and physical experiences. Astringent, pungent, bitter, and ununctuous foods, when consumed regularly, can lead to an imbalance in vata dosha and contribute to the development of vataja arsha. Additionally, consuming food in extremely small quantities, indulging in excessive alcohol consumption and sexual acts, and fasting can also contribute to this condition. Living in cold climates or seasons, engaging in physical exercise, and experiencing grief or exposure to sun and wind can also be potential causes of vataja arsha. Understanding these causes is crucial in preventing and managing this medical condition."
631,"The causes of pittaja arsha  are as follow:  Intake of pungent, hot, salty and alkaline food, excess exercise and exposure to the heat of fire and Sun Living in a place and season which are not cold, intake of alcohol and envy; Intake of drinks, food and drugs having vidahi (causing burning sensation), sharp and hot properties. [15-16]","Pittaja Arsha, a type of digestive disorder in Ayurvedic medicine, has specific causes that trigger its onset. The consumption of pungent, hot, salty, and alkaline foods is one such cause, as these can aggravate the digestive fire and lead to toxin accumulation. Excessive exercise and exposure to heat from fire and the sun also contribute to its development. Living in hot seasons and places without adequate cold exposure can create an imbalance in the body, leading to this condition. Moreover, the intake of alcohol and feelings of envy can further provoke Pittaja Arsha. Additionally, consuming foods, drinks, and drugs with vidahi (burning) properties or sharp and hot attributes can increase the likelihood of developing this ailment. Therefore, it is essential to avoid these causative factors to maintain digestive health and prevent Pittaja Arsha."
632,"The causes of kaphaja arsha (hemorrhoids) are as follow  Sweet, unctuous, cold, salty, sour and heavy food Lack of exercise, sleeping during day time and indulgence in the pleasure of beds and seats (excess sleeping and sitting) Direct exposure to wind Living in cold place and exposure to cold season and mental inactivity. [18-19]","Kaphaja arsha, also known as hemorrhoids, is a condition that can cause discomfort and pain for those who suffer from it. According to Ayurvedic medicine, there are several causes that can contribute to the development of this ailment. Consuming a diet that is sweet, unctuous, cold, salty, sour, and heavy can increase the likelihood of developing hemorrhoids. Additionally, a lack of exercise and excessive sleeping during the day can also contribute to their development. Those who indulge in the pleasure of beds and seats for extended periods of time may also be at risk. Exposure to wind, living in cold places, and experiencing cold seasons can also be factors that increase the risk of developing kaphaja arsha. Lastly, mental inactivity and a lack of physical stimulation can also contribute to this condition."
633,"The dwandaja arsha (in which two doshas are predo¬minantly aggravated) is caused by the combination of two types of etiological factors and clinical features of two doshas. If the causative factors of all the doshas are combined together, then tridosaja type of hemorrhoids (in which all the three doshas are simultaneously aggravated) is manifested. The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids are similar to those described for hereditary type of hemorrhoids- (vide verses 7 and 8 above). [20]","Hemorrhoids, a common health issue, can be classified into different types based on the dominant dosha aggravation. One such type is the dwandaja arsha, where two doshas are primarily affected due to the combination of specific etiological factors and clinical features. On the other hand, if all three doshas become simultaneously aggravated, it results in a more severe form known as tridosaja hemorrhoids. Interestingly, the symptoms of these two types closely resemble those of the hereditary form, thus making it essential to identify and manage them accurately. Understanding these distinctions can aid in selecting appropriate treatment measures for individual patients."
634,"Delayed digestion of the food, weakness, gurgling sound in the lower abdomen, emaciation, frequent eructation; pain in thighs, voiding less stool, anemia, apprehension of the manifestation of udararoga (obstinate abdominal disorders including ascites)-these are the premonitory signs and symptoms in the development of hemorrhoids. [21-22]","Hemorrhoids, a common health issue, can present with a variety of premonitory signs and symptoms that indicate the development of this condition. These early warning signals include a delay in the digestion of food, general feelings of weakness, and the presence of gurgling sounds in the lower abdomen. Emaciation and frequent eructation may also be observed. Additionally, individuals may experience pain in their thighs and notice a decrease in the frequency of stool production. Other symptoms can include anemia and an apprehension of udararoga, which refers to obstinate abdominal disorders such as ascites. By staying vigilant for these symptoms, individuals can take proactive steps to manage and treat hemorrhoids before they become more severe."
635,Hemorrhoids never manifest without the aggravation of all the three doshas. It is evident that the predominance of one or all the doshas determine the type of hemorrhoids. The nomenclature of doshaja arsha is given according to the predominance of dosha e.g. if vata dosha is predominat then that hemorrhoid is said to be vataja arsha. [23],"Hemorrhoids, a common ailment affecting many individuals, is a condition that is never present without the involvement of all three doshas in Ayurvedic medicine. The dominance of one or multiple doshas plays a significant role in determining the type and severity of hemorrhoids. When vata dosha is the primary factor, such hemorrhoids are referred to as vataja arsha, highlighting the importance of understanding the dosha balance in Ayurvedic diagnosis and treatment approaches."
636,"Five types of vata (prana, apana, vyana, udana and samana), pitta and kapha - all these morbid factors in their aggravated state afflict the three anal sphincters at ano-rectum and lead to hemorrhoids. These hemorrhoids are painful and are usually associated with several complications.  These hemorrhoids affect the whole body and so they are difficult to cure with conservative measures. [24-25]","Hemorrhoids, a common ailment affecting the anal region, can be traced back to an imbalance in the body's fundamental energies, or doshas, as outlined in Ayurvedic medicine. According to this ancient practice, there are three main doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Each of these doshas has several subtypes, including prana, apana, vyana, udana, and samana. When these doshas become aggravated, they can negatively impact the three anal sphincters located in the ano-rectum. Specifically, excess vata can lead to hemorrhoids, which can be painful and accompanied by various complications. Due to the interconnectedness of the body's systems in Ayurvedic belief, hemorrhoids can have far-reaching effects on overall health and may be difficult to treat with conservative measures alone."
637,"If the patient of hemorrhoids develops edema in upper and lower extremities, face, umbilicus, anus and scrotum, and if he suffers from pain in the cardiac region and lateral parts of chest, then such types of patients became incurable. [26] ","Hemorrhoid patients who unfortunately develop edema in various parts of their body, including the upper and lower extremities, face, umbilicus, anus, and scrotum, may find themselves facing a difficult prognosis. In addition to this widespread swelling, these patients often experience chest pain localized to the cardiac region and lateral parts. These symptoms combined can make the condition extremely challenging to treat, leaving some patients with few or no viable treatment options. The unfortunate reality is that for some patients with these specific symptoms, hemorrhoid treatment may be considered incurable."
638,"Pain in the cardiac region and lateral parts of the chest, fainting, vomiting, pain in the limbs, fever, thirst and perianal swelling - these complications lead to the death of the patient suffering from hemorrhoids. [27] ","Hemorrhoids, a common ailment affecting many individuals worldwide, can lead to severe complications if left untreated. The pain in the cardiac region and lateral parts of the chest, coupled with fainting and vomiting, can indicate advanced stages of the condition. Additionally, discomfort in the limbs, fever, and intense thirst are all common symptoms experienced by patients suffering from hemorrhoids. One of the most distressing symptoms, however, is perianal swelling, which can cause significant discomfort and pain. Unfortunately, if left untreated, these complications can ultimately lead to the patient's untimely death. Therefore, it is crucial to seek medical attention promptly if any of these symptoms arise to prevent further complications and ensure timely treatment."
639,Congenital/hereditary hemorrhoids caused by aggravation of three doshas and hemorrhoids located in the internal sphincter of the anus are also considered as incurable. [28] ,"Hemorrhoids, a common ailment affecting many individuals, can often be managed and treated effectively with various medical interventions. However, there are certain types of hemorrhoids that present a more challenging scenario for treatment. According to Ayurvedic principles, congenital or hereditary hemorrhoids, which are caused by an aggravation of the three doshas, or bodily energies, are considered incurable. Similarly, hemorrhoids that are located in the internal sphincter of the anus also pose significant difficulties in terms of treatment and management, making them essentially incurable. These types of hemorrhoids require a comprehensive and holistic approach to management, with a focus on mitigating symptoms and preventing further complications."
640,"In the presence of above incurable symptoms, if all four aspects of treatments like physician, drugs, attendant and patient are in the state of their excellence and if the patient has strong kayagni (power of digestion and metabolism) the disease may become yapya (palliative). Otherwise the disease became incurable. [29] ","In cases where a patient is faced with seemingly incurable symptoms, it is crucial to consider the role of each component involved in the treatment process. According to Ayurvedic principles, these components include the physician, the administered medication, the caretaker, and the patient themselves. When each aspect is functioning at its peak, there is a chance that the condition may shift from incurable to palliative, providing relief for the patient. A key factor in this transformation is the strength of the individual's kayagni, or their power of digestion and metabolism. When a person has a robust kayagni, their body is better equipped to process and respond to treatment, increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome. However, if any of these components are less than optimal, the disease may remain incurable."
641,"If the hemorrhoids are caused by vitiation of two doshas, and are located in the second anal- sphincter and if these are more than one year old, then these are difficult of cure.  ","The complexion of treatment for hemorrhoids is significantly influenced by their underlying causes. In cases where the condition is triggered by the vitiation of two vital bodily humors (doshas), and the affected area falls within the second anal sphincter, the prognosis becomes more challenging. The difficulty escalates further when these ailments have persisted for over a year. At this stage, the hemorrhoids become obstinate and difficult to cure completely, necessitating careful medical intervention and personalized treatment plans to alleviate the symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life."
642,"If the hemorrhoids are located in the external anal sphincter with vitiation of one dosha, and are not chronic then patient is said to be curable.  ","Hemorrhoids that are situated in the external anal sphincter and are affected by a single imbalanced dosha are considered curable, especially if they are not chronic in nature. This prognosis is based on the understanding of the body's natural constitution and the specific condition of the hemorrhoids. The external anal sphincter being affected can make the condition more manageable, as it is more accessible for treatment. Moreover, if only one dosha is involved in the imbalance, it is easier to address the root cause and promote healing. The non-chronic nature of the condition also aids in the recovery process, making it possible for patients to find relief from their symptoms."
643,A wise physician/surgeon should treat the patient early otherwise the enlarged hemorrhoids can obstruct the anal canal and lead to baddha-gudodara (obstruction in the passage of the ano-rectum). [30-32],"Early intervention is key to effective treatment of enlarged hemorrhoids, as advised by medical professionals. Neglecting this condition can lead to serious complications, such as obstruction in the ano-rectal passage, also known as baddha-gudodara. This condition can significantly impact a patient's quality of life, making it difficult for them to perform daily activities without discomfort or pain. By seeking timely medical attention, individuals with this condition can prevent potential obstructions, reduce their symptoms, and improve their overall health and well-being. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with a knowledgeable and experienced physician or surgeon who can provide appropriate treatment and guidance for managing enlarged hemorrhoids and preventing further complications."
644,"In the management of arsha,some physicians/surgeons advise  excision of the hemorrhoids by sharp instruments, while others recommend cauterization with ksharakarma (alkalies) and agnikarma (thermal cauterization). These procedures should be administered only by a physician/surgeon who is well trained in the field.   ","When it comes to managing piles or hemorrhoids in the Ayurvedic tradition known as Arsha, there are varying opinions among physicians and surgeons regarding the most effective course of treatment. Some advocate for the use of sharp instruments to excise the hemorrhoids, while others recommend the use of alkalies in a process called Ksharakarma or thermal cauterization known as Agnikarma. Regardless of the approach, it is crucial that these procedures be carried out by a medical professional who has received extensive training in this specialized field, to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient throughout the treatment process."
645,"Any mistake during these (surgical or para-surgical) procedures could result in serious consequences and complications, such as impotency, ano-rectal swelling, obstruction in defecation, abdominal distension, excruciating pain, excessive bleeding and recurrence of hemorrhoids. On healing stricture may form and chronic sticky /pus discharge, prolapse of the rectum can occur. Above complications may develop due to improper surgery, ksharakarma and agnikarma.   ","The significance of precision and expertise in surgical and para-surgical procedures cannot be overstated. A single mistake during these intricate processes can lead to severe consequences and complications, significantly impacting a patient's quality of life. Potential risks include impotency, ano-rectal swelling, obstructed defecation, abdominal distension, excruciating pain, excessive bleeding, and recurrence of hemorrhoids. Even after healing, one might experience stricture formation, chronic sticky or pus discharge, and, in extreme cases, prolapse of the rectum. These complications may arise due to improper surgical techniques, ksharakarma, or agnikarma, further emphasizing the need for meticulous care and proficiency in performing these delicate procedures."
646,Now the treatment which involve less of risk and which are not painful will be described for the eradication of hemorrhoids. [33-37],"When it comes to treating hemorrhoids, there are several options available that involve minimal risk and discomfort. Some of these treatments include over-the-counter creams, ointments, and suppositories, which can help to reduce swelling and irritation. In addition, sitz baths, which involve soaking the affected area in warm water, can provide relief and help to promote healing. For more severe cases, medical procedures such as rubber band ligation or infrared coagulation may be recommended. These procedures are typically quick, relatively painless, and can be performed in a doctor's office. By exploring these options, individuals with hemorrhoids can find effective relief without having to undergo extensive or invasive treatments."
647,Hemorrhoids caused by aggravation of vata and kapha are called dry hemorrhoids. Whereas those with excess discharge(bleeding) and wetness are caused by aggravation of rakta and pitta. [38],"Hemorrhoids, a common ailment affecting many individuals, can be classified into two categories based on their primary cause, according to Ayurvedic medicine. The first type, referred to as dry hemorrhoids, is caused by an imbalance in the vata and kapha doshas, leading to a lack of moisture and excessive dryness in the affected area. Conversely, wet or bleeding hemorrhoids result from an excess of rakta and pitta doshas, causing inflammation, discomfort, and discharge. Understanding these underlying causes is crucial in determining the appropriate course of treatment for this condition, as it allows for a more personalized approach to managing symptoms and promoting overall health and wellbeing."
648,"Dry, hard, inflamed and painful hemorrhoids should be first treated with fomentation. [39]","If you're dealing with dry, hard, inflamed, and painful hemorrhoids, starting treatment with fomentation is a wise choice. Fomentation is a soothing, moist heat treatment that can help to alleviate discomfort, reduce swelling, and promote healing in the affected area. By increasing blood flow and relaxing the muscles, fomentation can provide immediate relief from the pain and itching associated with hemorrhoids. To perform fomentation, simply soak a clean cloth in warm water and apply it to the affected area for 10-15 minutes, several times a day. This simple yet effective treatment can help to speed up the healing process and get you feeling better faster."
649,"The pile mass should be smeared with the help of the oil prepared by boiling chitraka (Plumbago zeylanica Linn.), alkalies and bilva (Aegle marmelos Carr.). Fomentation should be done with the help of the following formulations:  Pottali (medicines tied in a piece of cloth in the form of a bolus) containing yava (Hordeum vulgare Linn.), masha, kulattha (Vigna unquiculata (Linn.) walp and pulaka (tucchadhnnya ) Pottali prepared of the cake of the sesame seed Pottali containing husk of paddy. Pottali of vacha (Acarus calamus Linn.) and satahva (Anethum sowa Roxb.) The above mentioned recipes of pottali and pindas should be tolerably warm and should be added with fat. [40-41]  ","The process of healing a pile mass involves the application of a specially prepared oil, created by boiling chitraka, alkalies, and bilva. Once the pile mass has been sufficiently coated with this oil, the healing process continues with a series of fomentations. These fomentations involve a variety of mixtures, each tied into a cloth bolus, or pottali. The first pottali contains yava, masha, kulattha, and pulaka, while a second pottali is made from the cake of sesame seeds. Another pottali is created using husk of paddy, combined with vacha and satahva. These poultices should be added with fat and applied at a tolerably warm temperature, ensuring that the healing properties of these natural ingredients can be fully absorbed and utilized in the treatment process."
650,"Pinda containing sattu (roasted corn flour) and added with unctuous substances, like oil and ghee Pinda containing the pulp of dry radish Pinda containing karshnagandhika Pinda containing rasna (Pluchea lanceolata) Pinda containing hapusha The above mentioned recipes (no. 6 to 10) should be luke-warm and should be added with fat. The hemorrhoids mass should be smeared with oil prepared by boiling with rasna (Pluchea lanceolata). Thereafter, it should be fomented, with the help of a potalli containing brick powder, kharahva (Ajamoda/Apium leptophyllum (Pers.)) and the pulp of gunjanaka (Abrus precatorius Linn.). [39-43]","The preparation of specialized Pindas (boluses) is a crucial aspect of traditional healthcare practices. These Pindas can contain a variety of ingredients, each with its own unique benefits. For instance, a Pinda may contain sattu, a roasted corn flour, mixed with fatty substances such as oil and ghee for added richness. Another variation includes the pulp of dry radish, while others may incorporate karshnagandhika or rasna (Pluchea lanceolata). Yet another recipe calls for hapusha. It is important to note that all these Pindas should be lukewarm and infused with fat for maximum effectiveness. In cases of hemorrhoids, the affected area should be smeared with a specially prepared oil made by boiling rasna in addition to being treated with a fomentation made from a potalli containing brick powder, kharahva, and gunjanaka pulp. These traditional remedies offer a holistic approach to addressing various health concerns, rooted in ancient wisdom and practices."
651,"Recipe for Sprinkling: The hemorrhoids mass should be sprinkled with decoction of the leaves vasa (Adhatoda zeylanica Medic.), arka (Calotropis procera Ait.), eranda (Ricinus communis Linn.) and bilva (Aegle marmelos Carr.) [44]","If you're seeking relief from hemorrhoid discomfort, consider creating a homemade remedy using natural ingredients. According to a study, a mixture of crushed leaves from vasa (Adhatoda zeylanica Medic.), arka (Calotropis procera Ait.), eranda (Ricinus communis Linn.), and bilva (Aegle marmelos Carr.) could provide some relief. To create this remedy, prepare a decoction by boiling the crushed leaves in water until the mixture reduces to half its original volume. Allow the mixture to cool before straining it to remove any solid residue. Then, carefully sprinkle the affected area with the decoction, ensuring that it reaches the hemorrhoid mass. Repeat this process as needed to alleviate symptoms and promote healing."
652,"Recipes for sitz-bath : If there is pain in hemorrhoidal mass, then it should be well smeared with medicated oil and sitz-bath should be given with the help of decoction prepared by leaves of radish, triphala [Haritaki (Terminalia Chebula Roxb.), bibhitaka (Terminalia belerica Roxb.) and amalaka (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.)], arka (Calotropis procera Ait.), venu varuna (crataeva nurvala Buch-Ham), agnimantha (Clerodendrum phlomidis Linn.), shigru (Moringa oleifera Lam.) and ashmantaka.

Another option is to use cow's urine in the sitz-bath, which may provide additional therapeutic benefits."
654,"The fat black variety of cobra, pig, camel, jatuka and cat should be applied on the piles mass and also used for fumigation of piles.[48] ","The fatty, dark hue of specific animals has been traditionally utilized in certain medical practices. The fat of the black cobra, pig, camel, jatuka, and cat have been mentioned in historical texts for their role in treating a specific ailment: piles. These animal fats are to be applied topically on the mass itself, serving as a direct remedy. Furthermore, these fats are also utilized for fumigation purposes in the treatment of piles. This dual application showcases the significance of these animals in ancient medical treatments, highlighting a unique intersection between the natural world and healthcare practices of the past."
655,"Fumigation should be done with the help of human hair, serpent's slough, cat's skin, root of Arka (Calotropis procera Ait.) and leaf of shami. [49] ","The ancient practice of fumigation has been used for centuries to purify and cleanse spaces of negative energy and impurities.

766,"Bleeding stops if the patient takes freshly prepared ghee from butter, goat-meat, shashtika types of rice, freshly fermented sura (a type of alcoholic drink). [211]","In cases of bleeding, traditional remedies offer an interesting approach.

This unique combination is believed to have healing properties that can contribute to the cessation of excessive bleeding. However, it is crucial to note that these remedies should not replace professional medical attention, and anyone experiencing bleeding should seek immediate medical help."
767,"Predominance of vata: In case of excessive bleeding, the arsha becomes vata dominant.  Even if pitta and kapha are predominantly vitiated, then also predominance of vata shall be considered in excessive bleeding. [212]","When it comes to managing the condition known as arsha, or piles, in the context of Ayurvedic medicine, it is essential to consider the role of the doshas. According to this traditional Indian system of medicine, the body is composed of three primary energies or doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha. If a person experiences excessive bleeding associated with arsha, it is likely that vata dosha is predominant. This is true even in cases where pitta and kapha may also be vitiated or aggravated. Therefore, it is crucial to address the excess vata in order to effectively manage this condition and promote overall health and balance in the body."
768,"Cooling Therapy: If there is predominance of rakta and pitta and there is less of the signs and symptoms of aggravated kapha and vata, then the patient should be given cooling remedies which are already described and some of which are to be described later. [213]","Cooling Therapy plays a crucial role in the holistic approach to health and illness in Ayurveda, particularly in managing imbalances associated with aggravated pitta and rakta. According to Ayurvedic principles, if a patient exhibits a predominance of these doshas, with minimal symptoms of vata and kapha aggravation, cooling remedies should be administered. These remedies, some of which have already been described and others that will be discussed later in the text, serve to pacify pitta and rakta, thereby restoring balance and promoting overall well-being. By addressing these imbalances, cooling therapy ultimately contributes to a more balanced state of health, enabling the individual to experience greater vitality, clarity, and inner harmony."
769,"Sprinkling in bleeding hemorrhoids: To stop bleeding, hemorrhoids should be sprinkled with the decoctions of madhuka, panchavalka [barks of nyagrodha (ficus bengalensis), udumbara (ficus glomeruta), ashwatha (ficus religiosa), parisha (thespesia populnea)  and plaksha (ficus lacor)],  bark  of badar, udumbara (ficus glomeruta), dhava (Anogeissus latifolia) and patola (Tricosanthes dioica) or vasa (Adhatoda vasika), kakubha,Yavasaka (Alhagi camelorum) and nimba (Azadiracta indica).

[243]","In the ancient Indian medical system of Arsha, also known as Ayurveda, great importance is placed on the power of digestion and its impact on overall health. This is particularly relevant when treating patients with hemorrhoids. Practitioners of Arsha believe that certain foods can either exacerbate or alleviate the symptoms of this condition, depending on the individual's digestive power. For example, cold articles may be recommended at times to help cool and soothe the digestive system, while at other times hot articles may be prescribed to stimulate and energize it. Similarly, sweet or sour-tasting drugs or foods may be given to balance and normalize digestive function, based on their opposing characteristics.

[244-245]","The interdependence of hemorrhoids, diarrhea, and grahani is a complex relationship that is greatly influenced by the strength of an individual's digestive power, also known as Agni in Ayurvedic medicine. When Agni is weak, these conditions can become aggravated, leading to a worsening of symptoms and a decrease in overall health. On the other hand, when Agni is strong, the body is better able to digest food and absorb nutrients, which can lead to a reduction in symptoms and an improvement in these conditions. Therefore, maintaining a healthy digestive power is crucial for those suffering from these ailments. By focusing on strengthening Agni through dietary and lifestyle changes, individuals can take a proactive approach to managing these interdependent diseases and promoting overall well-being."

By examining these ancient texts, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of how to diagnose and treat respiratory ailments using time-tested techniques that have been passed down through generations. Join us on this journey through Ayurvedic medicine and discover the power of natural healing."
794,"Atreya, endowed with power of penance, fame and perseverance and super-intellect expounded the infallible therapies for the treatment of kasa. There are five types of kasa. If exacerbated they may cause kshaya. These five types are vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, kshataja and kshayaja. [3-4]","In the annals of ancient medical wisdom, Atreya, a figure revered for his power of penance, fame, perseverance, and super-intellect, imparted profound insights into the treatment of respiratory ailments known as kasa. This sage recognized five distinct categories of kasa, specifically vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, kshataja, and kshayaja, each possessing unique characteristics and challenges in treatment. Furthermore, Atreya cautioned that if left unchecked, these five types of kasa could potentially lead to a more severe condition called kshaya, thus highlighting the importance of timely and appropriate therapeutic intervention."
795,Following are the premonitory signs and symptoms of kasa:   Sensation as if throat and mouth are filled with shooka (thorns). Itching sensation in the throat. Inability to swallow food.[3-4],"Kasa, a condition that is believed to affect the throat and swallowing function, is often preceded by a number of distinctive signs and symptoms. A prevalent symptom is a sensation akin to having shooka, or thorns, trapped within the throat and mouth. This can create a feeling of discomfort and irritation that is difficult to ignore. Additionally, an itching sensation may also be present in the throat, further exacerbating the discomfort experienced by individuals suffering from kasa. Perhaps one of the most debilitating symptoms of this condition is the inability to swallow food properly, which can have serious implications for a person's overall health and wellbeing if left untreated."
796,"Vata being obstructed in the lower region of the body, moves upwards, afflicts the channels of circulation in the upper part of the body, takes over the function of udana vayu and gets localized in the throat and chest. ","When the free flow of Vata becomes impeded in the lower regions of the body, it has a tendency to move upward, affecting the channels of circulation in the upper part of the body. Once it has taken over the functions of Udana Vayu, it becomes localized in the throat and chest areas, potentially causing discomfort and a myriad of health issues. This localization can result in imbalances that affect respiratory functions, voice quality, and even mental clarity, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balanced and unobstructed flow of Vata throughout the entire body."
797,"Then entering all the cavities in the head, fills them up and causes hunching and convulsive movements of the body, jaws, sides of the neck and eyes. ","The mysterious substance, having gained access to the head, proceeds to occupy every cavity it can find. This invasion results in a series of distressing physical manifestations, including but not limited to hunching and uncontrollable convulsions of the body, jaws, eyes, and the sides of the neck. The unfortunate subject is left at the mercy of this unknown agent, unable to resist or even understand the nature of the affliction that has befallen them."
798,"Thereafter this obstructed vata causes contraction and stiffness of the eyes, back, chest and sides of the chest, gives rise to kasa which may be dry or with phlegm because of which it is known as kasa.[6-8]","The obstruction of vata, one of the vital energies in the body, can lead to a host of issues within the human system. Once obstructed, it can cause a contraction and stiffness in various parts of the body, including the eyes, back, chest, and the sides of the chest. This constriction can further result in kasa, an Ayurvedic term for cough, which can manifest either as a dry cough or one accompanied by phlegm. This is why it is often referred to as kasa in Ayurvedic texts, denoting the cough that arises due to the obstruction in the flow of vata."
799,"Specific variations in the pain and sound associated with different types of kasa are caused by the specific nature of the obstruction (by kapha, etc.) to the force fully moving vayu.[9]","The intensity and tone of pain experienced in different types of kasa, or coughs, can be attributed to the unique obstructions created by the aggravation of various doshas, such as kapha. These obstructions hinder the natural flow of vayu, or air, within the body, leading to distinct variations in the associated sounds produced during a coughing fit. According to Ayurvedic philosophy, a comprehensive understanding of these specific variations can provide valuable insights into the underlying imbalances within an individual's body, ultimately informing a more personalized approach to treatment and healing."
800,"Following are the causative factors of vatika type of kasa:  Intake of ruksha (dry), sheeta(cold), kashaya (astringent) type of food.

The upward movements increases vata after digestion of food.[10-13]","Vatika type of Kasa, a traditional Ayurvedic term for cough, is caused by several factors, including the consumption of dry, cold, and astringent foods, insufficient or excessive food intake, excessive sexual activity, suppression of natural urges, and physical exertion. The condition is marked by intense pain in the epigastric region, flanks, chest, and head, excessive hoarseness, dryness in the chest, throat, and mouth, horripilation, fainting, and a hollow or resonant sound during coughing. A weakened voice, illusory perceptions, and dry cough with scanty phlegm and pain are also common symptoms. Fortunately, Vatika Kasa can be alleviated by consuming oily, sour, salty, and warm foods and drinks, but it is essential to avoid aggravating upward movements after eating, which can further increase Vata dosha."
801,"Excessive intake of ushna, katu, vidahi, amla and kshara type of ahara; krodha, santapa , exposure to the heat of the fire and sun are the causative factors of pittaja kasa.  Signs and symptoms of pittaja kasa are as follows:  Yellowish sputum and eyes Bitter taste in mouth Voice disorders Feeling of smoke is being vomited out of the chest Morbid thirst, burning, illusive, anorexia and giddiness Appearance of twinkling stars in front of the eyes while coughing continuously Expectoration of sputum mixed with pitta. [14-16]","Pittaja kasa, a respiratory condition caused primarily by an excessive consumption of certain foods and environmental factors, is characterized by a unique set of signs and symptoms that distinguish it from other ailments. According to Ayurvedic principles, the overconsumption of ushna (heating), katu (pungent), vidahi (stimulating), amla (sour), and kshara (alkaline) types of ahara (food) can lead to an imbalance in the Pitta dosha, resulting in this specific form of respiratory distress. Accompanying factors such as uncontrolled anger (krodha), exposure to fire or sunlight (santapa), and even direct contact with heat sources can further exacerbate the condition. Those suffering from pittaja kasa may experience a range of symptoms including the production of yellowish sputum and a similar discoloration in the eyes, a bitter taste in the mouth, voice disorders, and a sensation of smoke being expelled from the chest. Additionally, individuals may also suffer from heightened thirst, a burning sensation throughout the body, dizziness or vertigo, and even visual disturbances such as seeing twinkling stars while coughing persistently. The expectoration of sputum tainted with pitta further confirms the diagnosis of this particular ailment, guiding practitioners in their quest for a targeted treatment approach to restore balance to the affected individual's constitution."
802,"Intake of  heavy to digest, slimy, excessive sweets and oily foods ; excessive sleep and habitual inertia leads to aggravation of kapha and thereby obstructs the movement of vata which gives rise to kaphaja type of kasa.  The signs and symptoms of kaphaja type of kasa are as follows:  Lowered digestion process, anorexia, vomitng, nasal discharge, nausea and heaviness Horripilation, stickiness and sweetness of the mouth Expectoration of thick, sweet, slimy, phlegm in large quantity Not feeling of pain in the chest while coughing Feeling of fullness in the chest [17-19]","Consuming a diet heavy in slimy, excessively sweet, and oily foods, along with a lack of physical activity and a tendency toward excessive sleeping, can contribute to an imbalance in the kapha dosha. This imbalance can lead to the development of a specific type of cough, known as kaphaja kasa. The symptoms of this condition include a lowered digestion process, loss of appetite, vomiting, nasal congestion, and a feeling of heaviness in the body. Other symptoms may include horripilation, a sticky sensation in the mouth, and the production of thick, sweet-tasting phlegm. Despite these symptoms, individuals with kaphaja kasa may not experience chest pain when coughing, and may instead feel a sense of fullness in the chest. Proper diet and lifestyle modifications can help to regulate the kapha dosha and alleviate the symptoms of kaphaja kasa."
803,"Excessive indulgence in vyavaya, carrying excessive heavy load, walking excessively long distance, indulgence in fighting, excessive indulgence in restraining the movement of horses and elephants etc. factors cause injury to the chest and bring about rukshata in the body and in turn causes aggravation of vata there by results in the manifestation of kshataja kasa. ","Engaging in excessive vyavaya, or strenuous activities, along with overloading the body and traveling long distances can lead to chest injuries and overall dryness in the body. This physical exertion can cause an imbalance and aggravation of vata, one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. As a result, kshataja kasa, a type of cough and respiratory disorder, manifests. Additionally, engaging in physical fights and restraining the movement of horses and elephants can also contribute to this imbalance and lead to the same respiratory disorder."
804," Signs and symptoms of kshataja kasa are as follows:  The cough will be dry in the beginning followed by blood tinged sputum Excessive pain in the throat and feeling of cracking pain in the chest Pricking type of pain as if pricked by sharp needles Excruciating pain and discomfort by touch on chest, miserable appearance. ","Kshataja Kasa is a medical condition that requires immediate attention, with a set of distinct symptoms that characterize it. In the onset, a persistent dry cough is experienced, that later on is accompanied by blood-tinged sputum. Additionally, the patient suffers from excessive throat pain, accompanied by a sharp, stabbing pain in the chest, similar to being pricked by sharp needles. The pain intensifies with touch, making it difficult for the patient to bear even light contact on the chest. As a result, the patient's appearance is miserable, reflecting the severity of their discomfort and pain."
805," Pain in joints and fingers, fever, labored breath, thirst and altered voice While coughing, sounds  humming like pigeon. [20-23]","If you're experiencing pain in your joints and fingers, accompanied by a fever and labored breathing, it could be a sign of a serious health condition. Additionally, if you find yourself feeling constantly thirsty and notice that your voice becomes altered and hoarse when you cough, it's possible that you may be suffering from an infection or illness that is affecting your respiratory system. One unusual symptom to look out for is a distinctive humming sound that has been described as sounding like a pigeon while coughing. This could be a sign that something is obstructing your airways or that your lungs are not functioning properly. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately."
806,"Intake of vishamashana and asatmya ahara, indulgence in vyavaya, suppression of vega, ghrina and shoka etc factors leads to vitiation of agni thereby aggravation of tridosha giving rise to kshayaja kasa.  ","The consumption of incompatible foods (vishamashana) and unwholesome meals (asatmya ahara) can lead to the disturbance of digestive fire (agni), which further contributes to the aggravation of the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha. This imbalance can result in a severe type of cough (kshayaja kasa) due to the suppression of natural urges (vega), feelings of disgust (ghrina), and sadness (shoka), among other factors. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet and lifestyle to ensure the optimal functioning of agni and prevent any imbalances that can lead to health issues."
807,"Signs and symptoms of kshayaja kasa are as follows:  Expectoration of the kapha, which is greenish, red in colour, associated with pus and bad odor.

Person suffers from diseases like jwara (having signs and symptoms of all dosha), nasal congestion, anorexia, painful flanks, altered voice. Feces hard or loose frequently without apparent cause stool. This is called kshayaja kasa which leads to the death of the patient if he is already very weak. If the patient is strong, then the disease can be cured.  ","Kshayaja kasa is a severe respiratory condition with a range of signs and symptoms that indicate advanced stages of consumption. The expectoration of greenish or red sputum mixed with pus and a foul odor is a common symptom. Coughing may cause the sensation of a displaced heart, and the patient may experience both hot and cold sensations unexpectedly. Excessive food consumption may occur, but the person may feel extremely weak and emaciated, with a clean and unctuous facial complexion, gracious appearance of face and eyes, and soft silky hands and feet. A negative shift in behavior may also be observed, with the person becoming highly critical and developing a hateful disposition. Other symptoms include fevers with signs and symptoms of all doshas, nasal congestion, loss of appetite, painful sides, altered voice, and irregular bowel movements. If left untreated, this condition can lead to death in weak patients, but it can be cured if the patient is strong."
808,"Kshataja kasa is palliable if the patient is strong. If these two diseases(kshataja and kshayaja) are in their initial stage and if all four chikitsa chatushpada are endowed with efficiency, then both of these are curable. All types of kasa are however palliable if the patient is old. [24-30]","Kshataja kasa, a specific type of cough in Ayurvedic medicine, can be managed effectively if the patient possesses strong vitality and the condition is identified and treated in its early stages. Both kshataja and kshayaja, another form of cough, can be cured when all four chikitsa chatushpada, the fundamental principles of Ayurvedic treatment, are effectively employed during the initial phase of the disease. However, it's important to note that all types of kasa become palliative rather than curable when the patient reaches an advanced age, regardless of the disease's stage or the efficiency of the treatment measures."
809,"The first three types of kasa (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja) should be treated as these are sadhya vyadhi. Whereas other two types (khataja and kshayaja) should be palliated with appropriate drugs and diet.  Treatment of different types of kasa has been described here after.[31]","In the realm of Ayurveda, kasa, or cough, is classified into five distinct categories: vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, khataja, and kshayaja. It is crucial to understand that the first three types - vataja, pittaja, and kaphaja - are considered curable, or sadhya vyadhi. These types require treatment that aims to eradicate the root cause. Conversely, the latter two types - khataja and kshayaja - are regarded as palliative conditions. These types necessitate management strategies that focus on alleviating symptoms and preventing further progression. This is achieved through the use of appropriate drugs and dietary measures, with the ultimate goal being to improve the patient's quality of life. This article will delve into the specific treatment approaches for each type of kasa."
810,"As dryness (rukshata) will be more prominent in vataja type of kasa, it should be treated with unctuous therapies (snehika upacharas).

If the person has dryness in the upper part of the body, and is associated with aggravated pitta, then he should be given medicated ghrita after intake of food.   If the person has dryness of the upper part of the body associated with kapha aggravation, then he should be treated with snigdha virechana.[32-34]","In the treatment of a vataja type of cough (kasa) characterized by dryness (rukshata), unctuous therapies (snehika upacharas) are recommended.

Additionally, abhyanga, parisheka (sprinkling or pouring), and snigdha sweda can help to reduce dryness and alleviate symptoms. If constipation and flatulence accompany the cough, basti is recommended.

819,"If there is pain in the shiras, nasa srava, arrhythmia of hridaya and pratishyaya in kasa then the physician should administer dhuma.

In the upper plate there should be a hole to which a tube, ten or eight angulas in length, should be inserted in slightly curved form. The patient suffering from kasa should smoke the fume emanating from this tube through his mouth. After the smoke pervades the entire chest, it should be smoked out through the mouth. Because of the sharpness of the ingredients used in this recipe, the phlegm located in the chest gets detached and forcibly thrown out as a result of which kasa caused by vayu and kapha gets alleviated. [65-68]","In the realm of ancient healing practices, the role of medicinal smoke or 'dhuma' holds significant importance. When a patient experiences discomfort in the form of headaches, running nose (shiras nasa srava), irregular heartbeat (hridaya arrhythmia), and chest congestion (kasa), the prescription of dhuma comes into play. A knowledgeable physician would prepare a concoction, using ingredients known to expel dosha from the body, sealed within two earthen plates. A tube, carefully curved and about eight to ten angulas long, emerges from a hole in the upper plate. The afflicted individual then inhales the smoke, which permeates the chest, ultimately expelling phlegm and alleviating kasa caused by vayu and kapha imbalances."

This particular remedy holds significant value in managing kaphaja-kasa, demonstrating the adaptability and wide range of applications for ayurvedic treatments across different dosha imbalances. The versatility of these natural remedies is a key aspect of Ayurveda, enabling practitioners to customize treatments based on individual constitutions and dosha dominance, all while harnessing the power of nature's pharmacy."
831,"If kaphaja kasa is associated with tamaka(a type of shwasa) then at this stage of kasa, therapies prescribed for pittaja kasa should be administered.   If there is association kapha in vataja kasa the kaphahara measures should be administered.  If pitta is associated with vataja and kaphaja kasa then pittahara measures should be followed.  If vataja and kaphaja kasa are associated with expectoration of phlegm, then rukshana therapy should be followed, whereas if not associated with phlegm then snigdha therapy should be administered.  If kaphaja kasa is associated with pitta, then the patient should be given food and drinks mixed with tikta dravyas.  Thus ends the description of kaphaja kasa.[131-134]","In the context of ayurvedic medicine, the treatment of a specific type of cough (kasa) is heavily dependent on its association with various doshas (kaphaja, pittaja, or vataja). For instance, if a kaphaja kasa is linked with a certain type of breathing difficulty (tamaka), therapies typically prescribed for a pittaja kasa should be administered. Similarly, if pitta is associated with both vataja and kaphaja kasas, pittahara measures should be followed. Furthermore, the consistency of phlegm expectorated during a cough plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate therapy. Rukshana therapy should be followed if phlegm is expectorated, whereas snigdha therapy should be administered if it's not. Finally, if kaphaja kasa is associated with pitta, the patient should be given food and drinks mixed with bitter dravyas, thereby concluding the description of kaphaja kasa.

This remedy is said to provide relief from kshatajakasa, shwasa, hridroga, and kshata, and is also beneficial for the elderly and those with low semen count."
833,"The medicaments prescribed for the pittaja kasa are also useful for kshatajakasa. Generally milk, ghee and honey should be given to such patients. If two dosha are involved in the pathogenesis of this ailment then special therapies are required.  If this ailment is associated with vata and pitta and the person has pain all over the body then abhyanga should be given with ghee. If there is excessive vata aggravation, causing pain, then abhyanga should  be given with taila prepared out of vatahara dravya.   The person suffering from kasa along with pain in hridaya and parshwa associated with burning sensation, hemoptysis and aggravation of vata should take jivaniya siddha ghrita.  If the person weak and habituated to take mamsa then the mamsarasa prepared out of lava is beneficial for him.   If he is suffering from trishna then he can take goats milk processed with trinapanchamoola.  If there is bleeding then he should take the ghee extracted out of this milk. Or this ghee can be administered in the form of nasya or as a drink.  If the patient of kshata is fatigued and weak, and if he has low power of digestion, then he should be given yavagu to eat.  If there is stambha and ayama then the patient should be given ghee in large quantity.  Thus all therapies which alleviate the vata, simultaneously which do not aggravate pitta and rakta should be followed in such persons.  After khsataja kasa treatment, after complete relief, still person is complaining of pain at the place of injury due to aggravation of kapha, should be given dhumapana chikitsa with following combination.

After dhumapana the person should drink ikshurasa and water mixed with jaggery.  Manhashila should be made into a paste by tritrating it with the vatashrunga. To this ghee should be added. After dhuma the person should be given tittiri pakshi mamsa rasa.  The silk cloth should be soaked with jivaniya gana dravyas or with egg yolk of kulinga. With this varti should be prepared and after dhumapana, the person should take the milk soaked with hot iron balls. This is beneficial in kshataja kasa.[138-148]","In addressing the respiratory ailment known as kshatajakasa, the same medications used for pittaja kasa can provide relief. For patients experiencing this condition with the involvement of two doshas, special therapies are necessary. In cases where vata and pitta are involved and the individual experiences pain throughout their body, abhyanga with ghee is recommended. If vata is excessively aggravated, causing pain, abhyanga with taila prepared from vatahara dravya is advised. Specialized therapies, such as dhumapana chikitsa, may be required based on individual symptoms and dosha involvement. For instance, if a person with kshataja kasa experiences pain at the site of injury due to kapha aggravation, dhumapana chikitsa with a combination of specific herbs, silk cloth, and iron balls can be beneficial after completing initial treatment and upon relief from the primary ailment. Throughout these treatments, it is essential to alleviate vata without aggravating pitta and rakta, considering each patient's unique constitution and condition."
834,"If kshayaja kasa is manifested with all the signs and symptoms, and if the patient is weak, then he should not be treated. However if the disease has recently occurred and if the patient is strong enough, then he may be treated even though the disease is incurable. In the beginning the person should be given brihmana therapy along with agni deepana. If dosha aggravation is more, then he can be given mild purgation therapy along with snigdha dravyas.  Ghee cooked with the decoction of shamapaka(fruit pulp of aragwadha), trivrit, mridvika rasa, tilvaka kashaya and vidari swarasa should be given in appropriate dosage for the shodhana of ksheena person. It protects the body as well as gives strength for the uras.

The initial therapy involves building up the patient's strength through brihmana therapy and stoking their digestive fire with agni deepana. If the disease symptoms become more severe, mild purgation therapy combined with soothing, nourishing substances may be administered. A specific ghee mixture, cooked with the decoction of various fruits and herbs, is recommended to purify the body and strengthen the chest region. For patients experiencing wasting of bodily tissues along with reduced pitta and kapha levels, a ghee preparation made from karkatashringi, milk, bala, and atibala is suggested. In cases where urinary discoloration or difficulty is present, milk boiled with vidari, kadamba, or tender tala fruits can be given.

","The mystical properties of certain natural elements have been the subject of much intrigue and exploration in various ancient cultures, including that of Svavit's quills. It is believed that when the quills are burned to ash, consuming them mixed with ghee, honey, and ikshurasa can provide relief from respiratory ailments like kasa and shwasa.

By adhering to this therapeutic regimen, healthcare practitioners aim to restore the patient's health and wellbeing through a holistic approach, thereby ensuring a smoother and more effective recovery process."
849,"Kshayajakasa is caused by sannipata. Therefore therapies which alleviate tridosha are to be administered for the treatment.  But still bala (strength) and abalata (weakness) of the disease is determined by the nature of aggravation of associated dosha. Keeping this in view, treatment should be administered.  The physician should know that among these five kasa, the succeeding ones are more serious than the preceding.  Different formulations mentioned under Kasa Chikitsa adhyaya are as follows:  Bhojya, pana, sarpi, leha, panaka, ksheera, sarpiguda and dhuma.[187-190]","Kshayajakasa, a respiratory disorder in Ayurveda, is caused by the confluence of various factors, known as sannipata. The treatment for this condition involves therapies that aim to restore the balance of tridosha – vata, pitta, and kapha – which when aggravated, determine the severity of the disease, whether it is a stage of strength (bala) or weakness (abalata). The nature and progression of the associated doshas play a crucial role in determining the treatment approach. It is important to note that among the five types of kasa, each one is more severe than the previous, highlighting the importance of early and appropriate intervention. A range of formulations listed under Kasa Chikitsa adhyaya, such as Bhojya, pana, sarpi, leha, panaka, ksheera, sarpiguda, and dhuma, may be administered based on the specific requirements and needs of the patient, emphasizing the personalized and holistic approach to Ayurvedic medicine."

Additionally, the chapter discusses sadhya-asadhyata, which examines curability and incurability, kasa bheshaja, which looks at medicinal formulations, and gariyastva, which compares the seriousness of different diseases. Together, these topics offer a holistic view of the disease process in Ayurvedic medicine. [191]"
851,Thus ends the eighteenth chapter in Chikitsa Sthana dealing with treatment of kasa in the work of Agnivesha which was redacted by Charak and because of non-availability supplemented by Dridhabala.,"The eighteenth chapter of Chikitsa Sthana, focusing on the treatment of kasa, comes to a close in Agnivesha's work, a profound contribution to Ayurvedic literature. This chapter has been carefully redacted by Charak, preserving its relevance and value for generations to come. As certain parts of the original text were lost over time, Dridhabala took it upon himself to supplement the missing sections, ensuring that the knowledge contained within remained intact and accessible for those seeking to understand and apply Ayurvedic principles to the treatment of respiratory ailments like kasa."
852,"Now we shall expound the first quarter of the chapter ""Abhayamalakiya Rasayana Pada"". Thus said Lord Atreya.[1-2]","In the sacred texts of Ayurveda, there lies a profound discussion on rejuvenation and longevity, penned by the revered sage, Abhayamalakiya. The first section of this chapter, known as ""Abhayamalakiya Rasayana Pada,"" contains invaluable knowledge that has been passed down through generations. According to Lord Atreya, it is now time for us to delve into and explore the wisdom encapsulated in this initial segment, aiming to understand and preserve the ancient teachings for modern generations to come."
853,"Chikitsa (measures which alleviate disorders), vyadhihara (destroyer of diseases), pathya (beneficial for the bodily channels), sadhana (instrument for therapeutic action), aushadha (that which is prepared of herbes), prayashchitta (expiation), prashamana (pacification), prakritisthapana (that which helps recovery to normalcy), hita (wholesome) – these are the synonyms of bheshaja (therapeutics).[3-4]","The concept of therapeutics, known as bheshaja, holds a significant place in ancient medical traditions. This idea is expanded upon through a series of synonyms, each offering a unique perspective on the healing process. For instance, 'chikitsa' represents measures that alleviate disorders, while 'vyadhihara' signifies the destruction or elimination of diseases from the body. 'Pathya' refers to treatments that benefit the bodily channels, promoting overall health and wellbeing. 'Sadhana' embodies the idea of an instrument or tool used in therapeutic action, emphasizing the importance of proper technique and execution in treatment. 'Aushadha' represents medicines prepared from herbs and other natural substances, highlighting the value placed on natural remedies in ancient healing practices. Additionally, 'prayashchitta' relates to expiation or atonement, suggesting a spiritual component to healing, while 'prashamana' denotes pacification, or calming down the disease process. Finally, 'prakritisthapana' implies restoration to normalcy, reflecting a holistic approach to healing that seeks to bring the body back into balance and harmony with itself. Together, these synonyms provide a comprehensive overview of the concept of bheshaja and its multifaceted role in promoting health and wellbeing."
854,"Therapeutics is of two categories:   that which promotes strength and immunity in the healthy, that which alleviates disorders. [4]","Therapeutics, a vital aspect of healthcare, can be broadly categorized into two main types. The first category focuses on promoting strength and boosting the immune system of healthy individuals. By reinforcing their natural defenses, these therapeutic measures help maintain overall well-being and ward off potential health issues. The second category targets the alleviation of disorders and diseases, providing relief and healing to those who are unwell. Through a combination of these approaches, therapeutics plays a crucial role in both prevention and treatment, making it an essential component of medical practice and health management."
855,"Abheshaja (non-therapeutics) is also of two types – (1) badhana (acute), (2) sanubadhana (chronic).[5]","Abheshaja, a concept in Ayurvedic medicine, refers to non-therapeutic measures and can be categorized into two types based on their duration and intensity. The first type, badhana, encompasses acute conditions that require immediate but temporary measures to alleviate symptoms and prevent further complications. The second type, sanubadhana, pertains to chronic conditions that necessitate long-term and consistent management strategies to maintain balance and promote overall well-being. Both forms of Abheshaja play a crucial role in Ayurvedic healing practices, emphasizing the importance of addressing both the root cause and manifestations of illnesses. (Word count: 94)"
856,"Therapeutics which promotes strength and immunity is categorized in vrishya (aphrodisiac) and Rasayana (promotives), while the therapy of the second category is mostly applied for alleviation of disorders. The word prayah specially denotes only particularity because both the groups perform both the above functions namely, promotion of strength including immunity and alleviation of diseases. [5-6]","The classification of therapeutic treatments in Ayurveda includes Vrishya and Rasayana, both of which promote strength and immunity in individuals. However, it is a common misconception that only Rasayana is used for alleviating disorders. In reality, both Vrishya and Rasayana serve dual purposes, promoting strength and immunity while also aiding in the treatment of various ailments. The term ""prayah"" specifically highlights this particularity, emphasizing that both categories of therapy are versatile and valuable in maintaining overall health and well-being."
857,"By promotive treatment, one attains longevity, memory, intelligence, freedom from illness, youthfulness, excellence of lustre, complexion and voice, optimum strength of physique and sense organs, perfection in deliberation, respectability and brilliance. Rasayana is the means of attaining excellent qualities of rasa etc. dhatus i.e. body cells and tissues. [7-8]","The ancient practice of Rasayana therapy, a form of promotive treatment in Ayurveda, offers a pathway to achieve longevity, enhanced memory, and intellect. It is also known to provide freedom from illness, imparting a youthful appearance and radiant complexion along with a melodious voice. With Rasayana, one can achieve optimum strength in both physique and sense organs, enabling better deliberation and decision-making abilities. Moreover, it enhances respectability and brilliance in individuals, making it a means to attain excellent qualities of rasa and other body tissues, ultimately leading to a balanced and holistic state of well-being."
858,"Vajikarana (aphrodisiac treatment) is that which produces lineage of progeny, quick sexual stimulation, enables one to perform sexual act with the women uninterruptedly and vigorously like a horse, makes one charming for the women, promotes corpulence and infallible and indestructible semen even in the old persons, renders one great having a number of off-springs like a sacred tree branched profusely and commanding respect and popularity in the society. By this one attains eternality based on filial tradition here and hereafter along with fame, fortune, strength and corpulence. [9-12]","Vajikarana, an ancient practice stemming from Ayurvedic medicine, focuses on enhancing reproductive systems and promoting overall health. This aphrodisiac treatment is believed to provide rapid sexual stimulation and enable sustained sexual performance, often compared to that of a horse. Beyond physical enhancement, Vajikarana aims to cultivate charm and allure, captivating women and fostering respect within society. A crucial aspect of this practice entails strengthening and securing semen, ensuring its vitality even in advanced age. By following this regimen, one can expect to increase offspring, wealth, and social standing, ultimately paving the way for a legacy celebrated in both the present and afterlife."
859,"Thus, the two fold promotive treatment for the healthy is described here. As regard the measures for alleviating diseases, those will be described in the concerned chapters on therapeutics. The sole purpose of therapeutics is to alleviate diseases. The method of Rasayana has been described first and thereafter the aphrodisiac measures have been described. [13-14]","The promotion of health is a two-part process, with distinct approaches to disease alleviation being explored in later chapters. The immediate focus lies on Rasayana, a method aimed at maintaining and improving overall health and well-being. Following this, the text delves into aphrodisiac measures, which, while often associated with sexual vitality, also have a broader role in promoting strength and vigor. It is important to note that these discussions on health promotion set the stage for the subsequent exploration of therapeutic interventions, which address specific diseases and ailments."
860,Abheshaja is that which is contrary to the bheshaja i.e. therapy. This is to be avoided whereas the bheshaja therapeutic measures are to be described further to be adopted. [15],"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, Abheshaja holds a significant meaning. It is described as something that is opposite to Bheshaja, which refers to therapeutic measures or treatments. Unlike Bheshaja, which involves various methods and techniques aimed at promoting healing, restoring balance, and preventing diseases, Abheshaja is to be avoided. It is essential to distinguish between the two and adhere to Bheshaja practices for maintaining overall health and well-being. The study and application of Bheshaja's therapeutic methods, such as proper nutrition, lifestyle changes, and various treatment modalities, can lead to improved health and longevity."
861,"The propounders have described two methods of the administration of Rasayana therapy, namely:   kutipraveshika (indoor) and vatatapika (outdoor).","Rasayana therapy, a vital branch of Ayurveda that focuses on rejuvenation and longevity, is administered through two main methods: kutipraveshika and vatatapika. The kutipraveshika method requires the individual to reside inside a specially designed room during the entire course of treatment, allowing for a controlled and intense healing process. On the other hand, the vatatapika method is conducted in a natural outdoor setting, where the patient undergoes the therapy while being exposed to fresh air and natural elements. Both methods have their unique benefits and are tailored to suit individual needs, ensuring optimal rejuvenation and overall well-being."
862," Firstly, the procedure of indoor treatment will be described. For this a cottage should be built in an auspicious ground, facing eastward or northward and in a locality inhabited by king, physicians and brahmanas, holy saints, is free from dangers, is auspicious and has easy availability of necessary materials.","The process of indoor treatment, as prescribed in ancient texts, begins with the construction of a cottage. This cottage must be built on ground that is considered auspicious and favorable for healing. Ideally, it should face either eastward or northward, and be located in an area inhabited by respected members of society, such as the king, physicians, and brahmanas (holy saints). The area should also be free from danger and ill-omens, and have easy access to necessary materials for treatment. This location is believed to create a positive and conducive environment for the patient's recovery and well-being."
863,"  The cottage should have sufficient space and height, three interior chambers one after the other, a small opening, and thick walls and should be comfortable for the seasons, neatly clean and favorable for the treatment. It should be impermeable for undesirable sound etc. (sense objects), free from women, equipped with necessary accessories and attended by physicians with medicines and brahmanas. ","When designing the ideal cottage for medical treatment, prioritize both space and height to ensure patient comfort. The interior should consist of three separate rooms arranged sequentially, with a small opening to allow for natural light and ventilation. Thick walls are essential to maintain a quiet environment, minimizing distractions from undesirable sounds. Additionally, the cottage must be well-sealed to prevent the intrusion of external sense objects. It is also recommended that women are not permitted to enter this space, ensuring a serene atmosphere conducive to healing. Amenities such as necessary medical equipment and supplies must be readily available, with skilled physicians and trained brahmanas present to administer treatment and care. Above all, the cottage must be kept meticulously clean and maintained at a favorable temperature for all seasons to provide optimal care and comfort for those seeking treatment."
864,"   Now, in northerly course of the sun, bright fortnight and auspicious date, star, hour and karana, one having clean- shaved, with strong restraint and memory, faith and focused mind, and stress-free state, feeling companionship with all the creatures.","As the sun takes its northerly course, marking the beginning of the bright fortnight and an auspicious date, it is time to gather one's resolve and prepare for the journey ahead. One must begin by shaving off all distractions, symbolizing a strong restraint over the mind and senses. A clear and focused mind, bolstered by faith and a stress-free state, is essential for the task at hand. Accompanied by a compassionate heart that feels companionship with all creatures, one must also take note of the favorable star, hour, and karana to ensure success in the endeavor."
865,"After worshipped the gods and brahmanas first and keeping the gods, cow and brahmanas to the right side, one should enter the cottage and be cleansed and thereafter when he feels happy and strong, he should use Rasayana treatment. Further I shall talk about the cleansing procedures. [16-24]","In the traditional ritualistic practice, it is believed that before entering one's cottage, one must first pay respect to the divine beings and the revered Brahmanas. The gods, cow, and Brahmanas are to be kept to the right side, symbolizing their importance and sanctity in this ancient cultural tradition. Once inside, the individual must undergo a cleansing process, preparing both body and mind for the ensuing Rasayana treatment. This therapeutic approach, aimed at rejuvenation and longevity, is initiated only after one feels purified, happy, and physically strong. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various steps and methods involved in these cleansing procedures."
866,"The individual scheduled to undergo Rasayana treatment, adequately oleated and fomented, should take formulations with hot water consisting of the powders of haritaki, rock salt, amalaka, jaggery, vacha, vidanga, haridra, long pepper and dry ginger. When he is evacuated properly by this procedure and has resumed the routine dietetic regimen, he should be given barley preparation added with ghee for three, five or seven days (according to measure of evacuation) till the accumulated feces are eliminated.","Prior to beginning the ancient Indian practice of Rasayana treatment, it is recommended that the individual prepares their body through a process of oleation and fomentation. This preparation is followed by consuming a mixture of powdered haritaki, rock salt, amalaka, jaggery, vacha, vidanga, haridra, long pepper, and dry ginger, all dissolved in hot water. This step is crucial for evacuating the system and allowing for the elimination of any accumulated feces. Once the individual has resumed their normal dietary routine, they may continue the treatment with a barley preparation mixed with ghee for a period of three to seven days. This final step serves to further cleanse and detoxify the system, ensuring the success of the Rasayana therapy."
867," Thus, when he is considered as having cleansed properly, the physician should administer the appropriately chosen Rasayana (drug) in consideration of his age, constitution and suitability. [25-28]","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, cleansing the body is a crucial preparatory step before administering rejuvenating therapies known as Rasayanas. The process of cleansing, or Shodhana, involves purging the body of toxins through various methods, depending on the individual's dosha or constitution. Once the physician determines that the person has undergone proper and complete cleansing, they then carefully select a Rasayana treatment that suits their age and constitution. This personalized approach allows for optimal benefits, promoting longevity, vitality, and overall well-being."
868,"Haritaki has five tastes devoid of saline taste, is hot, wholesome, carminative, light, appetizer, digestive, life promoting, tonic, excellent sustainer of youthfulness, relieves all diseases and affords strength to all sense organs. ","Haritaki, a widely revered fruit in Ayurvedic medicine, boasts a unique profile, offering five distinct tastes excluding salinity. Its heating property, along with its ability to promote digestion and alleviate gas, contributes to its reputation as a holistic remedy. Light and appetite-enhancing, haritaki also aids in sustaining overall youthfulness and enhancing the strength of our vital sense organs. Moreover, it offers a remarkable solution to various ailments while bolstering one's vitality. With its multi-faceted benefits and minimal side effects, haritaki indeed emerges as a highly desirable and natural approach to health improvement and disease prevention."
869,"It alleviates skin disorders including leprosy, gulma, udavarta, phthisis, anemia, degeneration, piles, disorders of grahani, chronic intermittent fever, heart disease, head disease, diarrhea, anorexia, cough, urinary diseases and diabetes, flatulence, splenomegaly, acute abdominal disorders, excessive secretion of mucus, hoarseness of voice, disorders of complexion, jaundice,worms oedema, bronchial asthma, vomiting, impotency.","The remarkable healing properties of this remedy have been lauded for centuries, offering relief for a vast array of ailments. From alleviating skin disorders such as leprosy and piles to easing internal complications like heart disease and bronchial asthma, its versatility is unmatched. Disorders of the grahani, chronic fevers, and jaundice are no match for its soothing effects. Even persistent conditions like anemia, diabetes, and cough find resolution under its care. Its ability to combat digestive issues like flatulence, acute abdominal disorders, and excessive mucus production further attests to its wide-ranging benefits. This remedy truly stands as a testament to holistic healing, offering reprieve for everything from debilitating worms to hoarseness of voice and impotency."
870,"Lassitude in organs, micro-obstructive  disorders, feeling of slugged heart and chest, sudden impairment of memory and intellect.  (The individuals having indigestion, consumption of rough food, emaciated by indulgence in women, wine and poisonous substances and afflicted with hunger, thirst and heat should avoid prolong use of haritaki.)  Amlaki has the same properties and actions as haritaki, only the bio-potency is different (haritaki being hot while amalaki is cold.) ","Haritaki and Amlaki, two powerful Ayurvedic herbs, have been known for their remarkable effects on the human body. However, individuals who suffer from lassitude in their organs, experience micro-obstructive disorders, or have a sluggish heart and chest should avoid prolonged use of Haritaki. This is especially true for those who indulge in unhealthy habits such as consuming rough food, women, wine, and poisonous substances, or those who are emaciated due to hunger and thirst. Amlaki, on the other hand, has similar properties and actions to Haritaki but has a different bio-potency - it is cold, unlike Haritaki which is hot. Moreover, individuals who experience a sudden impairment of memory and intellect should also be cautious while consuming these herbs."
871," Thus, looking to these actions, one should regard the fruits of haritaki as well as amlaki like nectar. [29-37]","In considering the significant benefits of natural ingredients, it is impossible to overlook the remarkable properties of haritaki and amlaki. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, these two powerful plants have been revered for their healing abilities and rejuvenating qualities for centuries. In fact, the fruits of both haritaki and amlaki are considered so potent that they are often referred to as ""nectar"" for their unparalleled ability to promote health and longevity. Therefore, if we are to follow the wisdom of our ancestors, incorporating haritaki and amlaki into our daily routine is a must."
872,"Himalaya is excellent among the mountains, which is the best habitat of medicinal plants. Hence one should obtain the fruits grown there in proper time, mature with taste and potency, replenished with the sun, air, shade and water in respective seasons according to need, and which are uneaten, un-purified, uninjured and non toxic. The excellent actions and uses of these fruits will be described now.

Unblemished and untainted by external factors, these fruits possess exceptional qualities and uses that will be explored in detail. The bounty of the Himalayas offers a treasure trove of natural healing and nourishment, making these fruits a true gift from nature's finest."
873,"The five sets (or pentads) of panchamula are taken in quantities of 400gm (each of the pentad), along with the fresh fruits of haritaki and amlaki in number of one thousand and three thousand respectively. ","In the traditional Ayurvedic practice, the preparation of a medicinal concoction known as Panchamula requires the careful measurement of its key ingredients.

With determination, he climbs one of the amalaki trees, selecting one laden with large, enticing fruits. A particular fruit is chosen, picked carefully from a branch.

Furthermore, honey can help alleviate symptoms associated with hiccups, throat disorders, piles, and disorders of grahani, a term referring to the stomach and small intestine. As a natural anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent, honey can also aid in managing paleness, intermittent fevers, and chronic rhinitis. Additionally, it may help reduce swelling and provide relief for gulma, a term used to describe abdominal masses or distension, and vatabalasaka, which refers to disorders related to imbalances in vata dosha, or the air element in the body."
907,"Ten pippali should be taken with milk on the first day. From the second day onwards up to the tenth day ten fruits should be increased daily. From the eleventh day the number of fruits should be decreased gradually in the same order till it comes to ten. After the medicine is digested the person should take shashtika rice with ghee extracted from milk. Thus the use of pippali in total number of one thousand is Rasayana in effect. The pippali fruits should be taken by the persons with high strength in the form of paste, by those with medium strength in that of decoction and by those with low strength in the form of powder keeping in view the doshas and diseases. ","The administration of pippali, also known as long pepper, is a time-honored tradition in Ayurvedic medicine, and this regimen involves a carefully orchestrated sequence of consumption over a span of ten days, followed by a specific diet. On the initial day, ten pippali fruits are recommended to be consumed along with milk. As each day passes, the number of fruits ingested is set to increase by ten, culminating in a total of one hundred fruits on the tenth day. Following this, the number of fruits consumed is gradually reduced, returning to ten fruits on the eleventh day. This intricate process is believed to have a rejuvenating impact on the body, or ""Rasayana"" effect, when one thousand pippali fruits have been consumed in total. The preparation and intake method of this potent medicinal fruit varies, depending on a person's individual strength and their unique dosha and disease considerations, with some advised to consume it in a paste form, others in a decoction, and those with lower strength prescribed a powdered form for maximum benefits. Finally, after digestion, it is customary to consume shashtika rice with ghee derived from milk, further enhancing the therapeutic potential of this Ayurvedic remedy."
908,"The initial use of ten pippali fruits is maximum, that of six is medium and that of three is minimum. These numbers are also applicable according to the degree of strength of the patient. The Rasayana use of pippali is bulk promoting, beneficial for voice and life span, alleviates spleen enlargement, sustains age and promotes intellect. [36-40]","Pippali, a powerful herb in Ayurvedic medicine, has been used for centuries to promote health and well-being. The use of ten pippali fruits is recommended for maximum strength, while six is considered medium and three is used for milder effects. This dosage can be adjusted according to the patient's degree of strength. One of the most notable benefits of pippali is its Rasayana properties, which promote bulk, improve voice quality, increase lifespan, reduce spleen enlargement, sustain age, and enhance intellect. With such a wide range of benefits, it's no wonder that pippali has been a staple in Ayurvedic medicine for so long."
909,"One haritaki after digestion, two bibhitaka before meal and four amalaki after meal should be taken with honey and ghee for a year. This triphala rasayana helps a person live for one hundred years free from senility and disease. (41-42)","If you're looking to improve your longevity and overall health, consider incorporating Triphala Rasayana into your daily routine. This ancient Ayurvedic practice involves consuming a mixture of three fruits - Haritaki, Bibhitaka, and Amalaki - in specific quantities with honey and ghee. According to Ayurvedic texts, taking one Haritaki after digestion, two Bibhitakas before a meal, and four Amalakis after a meal daily for a year can help one live for a century, free from senility and disease (41-42). While this may sound too good to be true, many believe in the healing properties of these fruits and their potential to promote a healthier lifestyle."
910,A new iron plate should be pasted with the paste of triphala. After twenty-four hours this paste should be collected and dissolved in honey water and consumed. After the medicine is digested one should take a meal with plenty of fat. By observing this procedure for a year one lives one hundred years free from senility and illness. [43-44],"The ancient practice of using a triphala paste on a new iron plate and consuming it as a medicine has been gaining attention for its potential health benefits. According to traditional texts, after applying the paste on the iron plate, it should be allowed to sit for twenty-four hours before being collected and dissolved in honey water. This concoction, once digested, is then followed by a meal rich in fats. For those willing to commit to this daily routine for a year, the promise is a life of longevity, free from senility and illness, reaching the age of one hundred years or more."
911,"Triphala mixed with madhuka, tugaksheeri, pippali along with honey and ghee or triphala with sugar is an effective Rasayana. [45]","Triphala, a powerful rejuvenator in Ayurveda, when combined with madhuka, tugaksheeri, pippali, honey, and ghee, forms a potent Rasayana or rejuvenating tonic. This mixture is believed to promote longevity, support digestion, and enhance overall well-being. On the other hand, mixing triphala with sugar can also create an effective Rasayana, although it may yield slightly different benefits compared to the former formulation. Exploring these ancient Ayurvedic remedies can offer valuable insights into holistic health practices and alternative approaches to promoting vitality and optimal functioning."
912,"Triphala along with all six metals including gold, vacha or with vidanga and pippali or with lavana taken with honey and ghee for a year promotes intellect, memory and strength, longevity and excellence and relieves senility and diseases.

913,"Shilajatu originates from four metals – gold, silver, copper and black iron and is slightly sour, astringent in taste, katu in vipaka and is moderate in veerya. This is Rasayana in effect and if applied methodically it is aphrodisiac and alleviates diseases. Its potency enhances if it is impregnated with decoction of drugs alleviating vata, pitta and kapha either singly or in combination. [48-50]","Shilajatu, a powerful Rasayana in Ayurvedic medicine, is believed to have its origins in four significant metals - gold, silver, copper, and black iron. With a slightly sour taste and an astringent quality, it transforms into a pungent vipaka and maintains a moderate veerya. As a potent aphrodisiac, Shilajatu not only enhances potency but also alleviates various diseases when administered appropriately. The addition of decoctions derived from drugs that counter vata, pitta, and kapha imbalances further amplifies its effectiveness, creating a synergistic effect that enhances its overall healing properties."
914,"Shilajatu is impregnated by dipping it in lukewarm decoction and then taking it out at the end of the day, repeating the process for a week. Shilajatu mixed with ashed metals should be taken with milk by the prescribed method. ","Shilajatu, a mineral compound used in Ayurvedic medicine, is traditionally prepared through a process of repetitive dipping in a lukewarm decoction and removal at the end of each day, continued for a week. This method ensures that the Shilajatu becomes infused with the properties of the decoction. In addition, Shilajatu can also be combined with ash from specific metals, following which, the mixture must be taken with milk according to a prescribed method. The combination of Shilajatu with other substances serves to enhance its therapeutic properties, making it a powerful tool in Ayurvedic healing practices."

916,"Specific characters according to the source and the method of administration will be explained now. The rocky ores of gold etc., when heated by the sun ooze a material like lac, soft, smooth and clear. This is shilajatu. Shilajatu obtained from gold ore is sweet, slightly bitter, having color like japa flower, pungent in vipaka and sheeta veerya. That obtained from silver ore is pungent, white, cold and sweet in vipaka. Shilajatu obtained from copper ore is like peacock neck, bitter, hot and pungent in vipaka. That which is like gugguluka is the best of all.","Shilajatu, a material of great significance in ancient medical practices, is known for its unique characteristics that vary based on its source and the method of extraction. When rocky ores of gold are exposed to the heat of the sun, they release a substance akin to lac, known as shilajatu. This form is characterized by its sweet and slightly bitter taste, a color similar to that of a japa flower, and pungent and cool properties. On the other hand, shilajatu derived from silver ores is recognized by its pungent taste, white color, cold nature, and sweet vipaka or post-digestive effect. Extracted from copper ores, shilajatu is identified by its bitter taste, resemblance to a peacock's neck, hot properties, and pungent vipaka. However, the form that is considered the best among all is the one that is similar to gugguluka in its properties."
917," All types of shilajatu smell like cow urine and are applicable in all conditions. However, in the use of Rasayana, the last one is preferred, the above types of shilajatu are useful in vata-pitta, kapha-pitta, kapha and tridosha respectively. [55-61]","Shilajatu, a revered substance in Ayurvedic medicine, is often identified by its distinct scent, reminiscent of cow urine. While it is universally applicable, its usage varies based on an individual's dosha composition. For those with a Vata-Pitta imbalance, the first type of Shilajatu is recommended, while the second type is preferred for Kapha-Pitta imbalance. The third type, with its more balanced properties, is suitable for Kapha predominant individuals. Interestingly, for those with a Tridoshic constitution, the last type of Shilajatu is considered most beneficial. Despite its peculiar smell, Shilajatu's versatility and potential health benefits make it a valuable addition to Ayurvedic practices."
918,"One should avoid vidahi and heavy substances particularly horse gram during consumption of shilajatu. Horse gram, due to exceedingly contradictory nature, breaks the stones as seen in the practice that is why its use is contraindicated. Milk, buttermilk, meat soup, vegetables soups, water, urine and various decoctions are used for dissolving shilajatu according to the object.","When it comes to consuming shilajatu, a powerful ayurvedic supplement, it's important to be mindful of what you eat alongside it. Specifically, it's advised to avoid vidahi (toxins) and heavy substances such as horse gram. This is because horse gram has a contradictory nature that can actually break down kidney stones, making its use counterproductive when taking shilajatu. Instead, opt for lighter fare such as milk, buttermilk, meat soup, vegetable soups, water, urine, or various decoctions to help dissolve shilajatu according to your specific needs. By being mindful of these guidelines, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your shilajatu supplement and supporting your overall health and wellbeing."

931,"The indoor regimen of Rasayana therapy is prescribed for those who are fit, disease free, wise, self controlled, leisurely and are wealthy otherwise the outdoor method of vatatapika rasayana therapy is advisable. The former kind of regimen is, no doubt superior but is difficult to operate. If during the treatment some complications arise due to faulty methods, better treatment is planned after discontinuing the initial course of Rasayana therapy. [27-29]","In the ancient Indian practice of Rasayana therapy, two types of regimens are followed - indoor and outdoor. The indoor method, also known as Aindra Rasayana, is recommended for individuals who are healthy, disease-free, wise, self-controlled, and affluent. This method is considered superior due to its intensive and focused approach, but it is also more challenging to execute. On the other hand, the outdoor method, known as Vatatapika Rasayana, is advised for those who do not meet the criteria for the indoor method. However, if any complications arise during the indoor treatment due to improper methods, it is necessary to discontinue the course and plan a better treatment strategy. This highlights the importance of careful execution and monitoring in the indoor method of Rasayana therapy."

A commitment to temperance, including abstaining from alcohol and intimate relationships, is also essential. Non-violence, meditation, and cleanliness are important practices to cultivate, as is a sense of calmness and a soft-spoken nature. Engaging in charitable activities, practicing self-discipline and penance, and worshiping gods, cows, brahmanas, gurus, preceptors, and elders with devotion are all key aspects of this holistic approach to well-being. Demonstrating love and compassion towards all beings, maintaining vigilance and a balanced sleep schedule, consuming ghee made from milk in moderation, and surrounding oneself with wise company are also crucial elements of this ancient regimen.

934,"An individual can never get the benefits of Rasayana if he has not undergone grossly the process of samsodhana of his physical as well as mental impurities. The treatment meant for providing longevity and for relieving senility and disease succeed in persons having purified mind and body controlled self. Such a treatment should not be prescribed to those who have degenerate self, are disease free, are not twice born and who are reluctant to receive such a treatment. [36-38]","Achieving the full advantages of Rasayana therapy requires an individual to first undergo the purification process of samsodhana, which targets both physical and mental impurities. This is because the treatment for prolonging life, alleviating senility, and curing diseases is most effective in those who possess a pure mind and body, and who have achieved self-control. Conversely, such treatment should not be recommended for those with degenerate selves, who are free from disease, are not ""twice born,"" and who show reluctance to undergo this transformative therapy. By prioritizing samsodhana, one can lay the foundation for a successful and fruitful Rasayana experience, ultimately leading to a healthier and more fulfilling life."
935,"The Rasayana preparations, vajikarana recipes and remedies designed for the treatment of diseases – all depend on (vision and skill of) the physician. Hence the wise should honour with all means the treating physician who promotes life, is wise and well versed in the science of life as the king of gods honours Ashwins.  Ashwins are the physicians of gods and carriers of sacrifices. ","The Rasayana preparations and Vajikarana recipes, serving as the backbone of medical treatments and disease management, lie in the hands of a skilled physician. The proficiency of these remedials directly correlates to the vision and expertise of the healer, making them a figure deserving of great respect and admiration. Paralleling the esteemed role of Ashwins, the divine physicians to the gods, the human equivalent tends to the ailments of mortals, promoting life and preserving health through their deep understanding of the science of life. Thus, it is only fitting to honor such a physician with the same reverence bestowed upon the king of gods honoring Ashwins, recognizing their invaluable contribution to our wellbeing."
936,The head of sacrifice was cut which was joined by Ashwins. ,"In the ancient practice of sacrifice, it was believed that offerings made to the divine would ensure prosperity and fertility for the land and its people. Among the many symbols and rituals that comprised this custom, one notable act involved the beheading of a sacrificial animal, known as the ""head of sacrifice."" According to Indian mythology, this grisly task was often performed by the divine twins, known as the Ashwins, who were revered for their strength and skill. Together, they would sever the head in a single, swift motion, in hopes that the offering would be accepted and bring forth blessings upon the community."
937,"The fallen teeth of Pushan, destroyed eyes of Bhaga and the spastic arm of Vajrina were treated by them and thus he, addicted to soma drink, was again made happy. ","In ancient Indian mythology, the celestial being known as Dhanvantari was revered for his extraordinary healing abilities. Among his most renowned feats was the restoration of the fallen teeth of Pushan, the blinded eyes of Bhaga, and the spastic arm of Vajrina. Such was his devotion to the healing arts that he himself was an addict of the divine elixir, soma. Through his selfless acts of restoration, Dhanvantari brought happiness back to these afflicted deities, cementing his status as a symbol of healing and compassion in ancient texts."
938,"Chyavana, the descendent of Bhrigu, who was sexually indulged and became diseased, devoid of complexion and voice in old age, was reverted to youthful age. On account of these and other similar achievements, the two excellent physicians became highly adorable to the great selves like Indra, etc. and vessels, praises, recitations, various food preparations, incenses and animals are offered to them by the twins born.","Chyavana, the illustrious descendant of Bhrigu, regained his youthful vigor and complexion through the extraordinary healing prowess of the celebrated Aswin twins, the divine physicians. Their remarkable rejuvenation of Chyavana led to their immense adoration from influential figures like Indra and many other revered celestial beings. In honor of their incredible accomplishments, various offerings such as vessels, praises, recitations, delectable food preparations, fragrant incenses, and even animals were bestowed upon the Aswin twins. The twins' extraordinary abilities in the medical field were justifiably celebrated, making them beloved and highly respected figures in the celestial community."
939," In the morning, Indra enjoys the soma drink in the company of Ashwins and he also makes pleasure along with them in the sautramani sacrifice. Indra, Agni and Ashwins were worshipped mostly by the twin born and are praised in the vedic hymns, not so the other gods. ","In the early hours of the day, the revered Hindu god Indra can often be found sharing in a sacred ritual with the Ashwins, partaking in the delightful soma drink. Accompanying them in this sacred ceremony, known as the sautramani sacrifice, is a testament to their close bond and mutual admiration. These three figures, Indra, Agni, and Ashwins, were held in particularly high esteem among the twin-born and are frequently mentioned and praised in the ancient Vedic hymns. This is in contrast to some of the other Hindu gods who may not have received as much devotion and recognition in these religious texts."
940," Thus the twin physicians Ashwins are worshipped by the gods and their masters. Then how should the physicians not be honored with all means by mortals who are affected by the death, diseases and senility and after the search of happiness? The physicians who is endowed with good conduct, wisdom and rationality, is thrice born, well versed in scriptures and master of life should be honored as preceptor by the people. [39-51]","The divine twin physicians, Ashwins, are held in high esteem and revered by the gods and their masters. It is only fitting for mortals, who are vulnerable to the vagaries of death, diseases, and aging, to honor and respect physicians who provide them with care and solace. A physician, who embodies good conduct, wisdom, and rationality, is likened to a thrice-born, well-versed in scriptures, and a master of life. They are deserving of the highest recognition and should be held in the same regard as a guru, guiding us through the path of health and wellness. Thus, people must extend their gratitude and appreciation to these individuals who dedicate their lives to the service of others."
941,"After completing the course of training, it is the third birth of a physician because the physician does not carry the epithet vaidya from the previous birth. On completion of training, Brahma or Arsha psyche enters in to him certainly according to the knowledge. Hence the physician is known as the thrice born. The wise, desirous of stable life, should not backbite, re approach and harm the master of life. [52-54]","The journey to becoming a physician is a profound and transformative process, often referred to as the 'third birth' in ancient texts. Upon completion of rigorous training, a physician acquires a new identity, free from any previous titles or designations. This is made possible by the infusion of higher consciousness or 'Brahma' or 'Arsha psyche', which bestows upon them the knowledge and wisdom required to uphold the sacred duty of preserving life. Therefore, it is considered essential for individuals seeking a stable and wise life to refrain from criticizing or causing harm to their revered teachers and mentors, who are considered the masters of life."
942,"The treated patient, whether having promised or not, if does not offer any thing to the physician he is not freed. The physician too should consider all his patients as his own sons; protect them sincerely from all the ailments, wishing the excellent piety.  ","In the realm of medical ethics, ancient wisdom imparts a profound lesson. A physician who has treated a patient, whether or not a promise of payment has been made, does not conclude their duty until they have made their best effort to restore health. Similarly, the physician should regard all patients as their own kin, caring for them with unwavering dedication and seeking their wellbeing in body and spirit. This sacred bond transcends material transactions, creating a connection built on trust, compassion, and a shared pursuit of healing."
943,Ayurveda has been empowered by the great rishis devoted to piety and wishing immortality for welfare and not for earning or enjoyment. One who takes up the treatment only for human welfare and not for earning or self enjoyment supersedes all and those who sell the regimen of therapy for livelihood and devoted to the heap of dust leaving aside the store of gold.  ,"Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is a divine gift to mankind, bestowed upon us by selfless rishis who sought nothing but the betterment of humanity. These spiritual sages were dedicated to the pursuit of piety, and their ultimate goal was to achieve immortality for the benefit of all, not for personal gain or enjoyment. Those who follow in their footsteps, using Ayurvedic principles to heal and help others, are truly blessed, rising above all materialistic considerations. Unfortunately, there are those who exploit this sacred knowledge, using it as a means to earn a living, rather than as a way to serve humanity. Such individuals, who turn their backs on the true spirit of Ayurveda, are destined to lead shallow lives, missing out on the boundless treasure of spiritual growth and enlightenment that comes from selfless service."
944,"One who provides life to those being dragged to the abode of death by severe diseases while cutting the death nets cannot be simulated with any other donor of virtue and wealth because there is no charity better than providing life. The physician who is compassionate on living being as the highest virtue, proceeds in treatment of patients, achieves all objects and enjoy maximum happiness. [55-62]","The act of providing life to those on the brink of death's door due to grave illnesses is a noble and selfless gesture that cannot be replicated or surpassed by any other form of charity or good deed. The physician, who values the living being's well-being above all else and dedicates themselves to the treatment and healing of their patients, is truly a embodiment of virtue and morality. By saving lives and alleviating suffering, they not only achieve professional success and fulfillment, but also experience a deep sense of joy and happiness that comes from making a positive impact on the lives of others. In this way, the compassionate physician is truly unique in their ability to bring about profound change and improve the world around them."
945,"Now the summing up verses –   The rising of the science of life, method of celestial Rasayana drugs, ratnarasayana accomplished like nectar and delivered by the king of gods to the accomplished and intellectuals, all this has been explained in the quarter of the rising of the science of life. [63-64]","In the closing verses of this text, we find ourselves reflecting on the profound teachings related to the science of life and its significance. This ancient knowledge, often referred to as celestial Rasayana drugs, holds the potential to elevate one's existence to divine-like heights. As the narrator elaborates on this concept, they introduce us to the concept of ratnarasayana - a nectar-like substance that brings about rejuvenation and longevity. It is said that this knowledge was once delivered by Indra, the king of gods himself, to a select group of accomplished and intellectually gifted individuals. This wisdom, detailing the intricacies and benefits of this transformative practice, is woven throughout the quarter dedicated to the rising of the science of life."
946,Thus ends the fourth quarter on the rise of Ayurveda in the chapter of Rasayana in Chikitsa Sthana in the treatise composed by Agnivesha and redacted by Charak.[4],"The treatise composed by Agnivesha and redacted by Charak has reached its conclusion for the fourth quarter, focusing on the rise of Ayurveda in the realm of Rasayana, as presented in Chikitsa Sthana.

As we bid farewell to this part of the text, we are left with a deeper appreciation for the timeless wisdom and enduring relevance of Charak's contributions to the field of Ayurveda."
947,"Now we shall expound the first quarter section entitled Samyoga Sharamooliya on the virilification. Thus, said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the study of virilification, Lord Atreya begins by delving into the first quarter section, known as Samyoga Sharamooliya. This section is crucial to understanding the process of virilification, as it provides valuable insights and teachings that lay the foundation for the rest of the study. As we explore this section, we will uncover the knowledge and wisdom that Lord Atreya has to share, furthering our understanding of this complex and fascinating subject. So, let us begin our journey into Samyoga Sharamooliya and discover the wealth of information it has to offer."
948,"A person should always seek the intake of aphrodisiacs because he can earn dharma (eternal duties), artha (wealth, means of pleasure), preeti (desire or love or affection) and yasha (success) through this therapy alone.","The consumption of aphrodisiacs has long been associated with various benefits, according to ancient teachings. It is believed that through the intake of these substances, a person can not only enhance their desire and love but also gain eternal duties, wealth, and success. Aphrodisiac therapy is considered a holistic approach to improving one's life, promoting love, and achieving prosperity and fame. By incorporating these elements into one's lifestyle, one can lead a more fulfilling and balanced life, grounded in love, wealth, and duty."
949,"He gets these benefits through his progeny and this therapy is the means of begetting a healthy progeny. The best agent for virilification is a sexually excited female partner. Every sense can give immense pleasure, when involved separately (in act of sexual satisfaction); then what can be said (about the pleasure), if a woman whose all senses are extremely excited (for sexual satisfaction).","The concept of virilification, and the resulting benefits to one's progeny, lies at the heart of this discussion. A key component of this process is the role of a sexually excited female partner, who serves as the best agent for virilification. The potential for pleasure during sexual satisfaction is vast, as each sense can provide intense pleasure when experienced individually. But when all the senses of a woman are heightened with excitement, the pleasure that can be derived takes on a whole new level, making the experience all the more fulfilling and significant in the context of this therapy."
950,"  In a woman only, all the sense objects are collected together (to give pleasure). Therefore, this type of woman can give maximum pleasure to a man. The woman is the most lovable object for a man.It is the woman, who procreates children. ","The concept of femininity has been long associated with the idea of being a giver of pleasure in many cultures. This notion is rooted in the idea that within a woman, all the sense objects are collected together, creating a unique capacity for providing maximum sensory satisfaction to a man. Moreover, women are not only the most lovable objects for men but also the creators of life. Their role in procreation further elevates their significance and value in society, making them an object of profound admiration and reverence."
951,"Righteousness, wealth, auspiciousness and the entire universe are established in a woman. The woman, who is good looking, young, endowed with auspicious signs, amiable and skilled, acts as the best virilific. [3-7]","At the very foundation of society lies the importance of a woman, who embodies righteousness, wealth, and auspiciousness, forming the very fabric that establishes the universe we know. A woman, blessed with stunning looks, youthful charm, and fortuitous signs, becomes an embodiment of pure potential and virility. Her amiable demeanor and admirable skills only add to her allure, making her a true harbinger of life's abundant blessings. In this way, women hold a special place in our world, one that is worthy of recognition and celebration."
952,"Every individual in this world has different likings based on the effects of the actions in the past life e.g a person gets a woman of his liking, then his complexion and other qualities grow.","The notion that our preferences and experiences in this life are shaped by our actions from previous lives is a deeply rooted belief in many cultures and philosophies. For instance, the idea that an individual is drawn to a particular woman is not merely a coincidence, but rather the result of positive actions taken in the past. According to this belief, the attraction is not only based on physical appearance, but also on the growth and development of certain qualities and traits that the person has earned through their past actions. This concept suggests that our experiences and relationships in this life are not random, but rather are influenced by our own actions and behaviors from lives before."
953,"The woman endears herself into the heart of a person by the youthfulness, body, speech and gesture as a result of either daiva or karma (destiny, or the effects of the actions in the past life). The one, who delights the heart, who is like the god of sex, who bears similarities in mental faculties with those of her husband, who is amiable and loved by her lover and who enthralls all his senses by her excellent qualities, works like a noose of all the objects of senses. ","The woman who captivates the heart of an individual does so through a combination of factors, both natural and earned. Her youthful allure, physical beauty, and charming demeanor can be attributed to her destiny or daiva. Meanwhile, her mental faculties, which mirror those of her husband's, her amiability, and her loved status in the eyes of her lover's, are all results of her own actions or karma from her past life. With her excellent qualities, she ensnares all of her lover's senses, becoming a virtual noose that binds him to her, making her the object of all his desires and affections."
954,"A person who is deprived of her i.e. who doesn’t have a wife, does not find any interest in this world.  Without her, the person feels his body a burden and as if devoid of its senses, at the sight of whom, he does not get seriously afflicted even when he faces grief, anxiety, detachment and frightful situations. Because of her presence, the person becomes assured and excited and always rushes to her with excitement as if he remains unsatisfied. Such a woman is the best virilific to him.                                 ","The significance of a spouse in an individual's life is immeasurable and transcends superficial understanding. When a person lacks a partner, they may feel disconnected and unmotivated in their life's journey. The absence of a wife can make one feel weighed down, as if their senses are dulled and incapable of experiencing the full range of emotions. Even in the face of adversity or distress, they may struggle to feel deeply affected or concerned. In contrast, when in the company of their better half, they may feel invigorated and confident, with a sense of excitement and fulfillment that propels them forward. Such a woman, who can inspire and uplift her partner in this way, is truly a priceless treasure and virilific to him."
955,"The aphrodisiac qualities of a woman differ from man to man. The person, who is healthy and desirous of a child, should enter in to sexual intercourse with a woman who belongs to a different clan, who is free from diseases, who is sexually excited, cheerful and who has taken her post menstrual purifacatory bath. [8-15]","The aphrodisiac qualities of a woman have been a subject of interest and intrigue for many cultures and societies throughout history. According to ancient wisdom, certain characteristics in a woman were believed to enhance her appeal and potency as an aphrodisiac. It was thought that a healthy man, particularly one wanting to conceive, would benefit from sexual union with a woman of a different clan, as this was considered to increase the chances of conception. Furthermore, it was advised that the woman should be free from diseases, sexually excited, cheerful, and have recently completed her post-menstrual purification bath. These factors were believed to create a harmonious balance, increasing the potential for pleasure and procreation between the couple."
956,"A person without a child is just like a solitary tree with branches devoid of fruits and shadows and is devoid of any pleasant smell. The man without progeny is like an idol made of grass wearing the grab of a man. He is regarded as a painted lamp, a dried up lake or a pseudo metal which has the appearance of a precious metal. He is regarded not to be well established, bare, like a void and possesses only one sense organ and as having lived a purposeless life. ","A childless person, according to this perspective, finds themselves in a barren existence, comparable to a tree bereft of fruit, shade, and fragrance. This solitary individual is seen as a grass effigy dressed in human form, lacking the true essence of life. Like a painted lamp, they may appear to shine, but their light fails to illuminate; like a dried-up lake, they once held potential but now lie empty; like pseudo metal, they lack the true value of a precious life lived to its fullest. Such individuals, it is said, have yet to establish their purpose, wandering through life bereft, with but one sense organ to experience their world, ultimately leaving others to question the worth of their existence."
957," While, the person having numerous progeny is praised as one possessing a multiplicity of forms, having many faces, many dimensions, having lot of activities and having many eyes and also having intellect and soul. Such kind of a person is auspicious, praiseworthy, blessed, virile and the source of many genealogical branches. Affection, strength, happiness, livelihood, wide spread influence, vastness of kinsmen, fame, utility of the world which gives happiness latter on and pleasure are all dependent up on progeny. Therefore, a person desirous of progeny and the qualities associated with them should always take the virilifying medications if he wants satisfaction of the worldly desires and happiness. [16-23]","In various cultural and philosophical contexts, a person who is blessed with numerous offspring is often viewed with admiration and high regard. This individual is considered to embody multiple aspects, manifesting in various activities and facets of life, much like a multi-dimensional being with many faces. Such a person is seen as a potent symbol of fertility, intellect, and soul, and is often associated with auspiciousness and blessings.

The significance of progeny extends beyond social and familial roles, encompassing various dimensions of happiness, affection, strength, and influence. The offspring serve as the very roots of one's lineage and legacy, providing sustenance and support to their kin and ensuring the continuity of their family name and traditions. Therefore, those who aspire for such worldly satisfaction and happiness are encouraged to seek virilifying medications to enhance their chances of procreating and embracing these multifaceted joys and benefits."

1003,"Now we shall describe how a man whose virility has been enhanced is enabled to have sexual intercourse with women to get the progeny very soon. It is not that all men possessing physical strength get their progeny soon. There are persons who are great in body built and strength, but are very weak for sexual activities. ","The enhancement of virility allows a man to engage in intimate relations with women, significantly reducing the time it takes to conceive. It is important to note that not all physically strong men are guaranteed this ability; there are those who possess impressive physiques and strength but may still lack the necessary vitality for reproductive activities. The distinction lies in the possession of a potent virility, an essential factor that plays a crucial role in ensuring the conception of progeny."
1004,"There are some persons who are lean and thin in body built but are sexually very strong and have many children. There are some persons who are weak by nature and some have become weak due to diseases.

There are some persons who get their sexual vitality at a particular season, some get because of regular habit, some by taking virilific preparations, and some are virile by nature.   Therefore, some preparations are mentioned here, which invigorate the infirm and which increase the virility of the strong and enhance their enjoyment. Firstly, the person should be purified by the administration of niruha and anuvasana types of enema and after that, semen and progeny promoting preparations should be administered. To the persons, enema prepared from ghee, oil, meat juice, milk, sugar and honey should be administered. During this therapy, the person shall consume milk and meat juice [3-10]","In the realm of human physiology, there exists a wide range of variations in sexual vitality and reproductive capabilities that are not necessarily tied to body type or weight. Some individuals, despite their lean appearance, possess remarkable sexual strength and have procreated multiple times. Meanwhile, others may be naturally weak or weakened by illness, leading to reduced sexual vitality.

Frequent sexual activity does not always correlate with increased fertility, as some individuals engage in sexual activity often but produce little semen, while others do so less frequently yet release large amounts of semen during intercourse. Moreover, sexual vitality can be influenced by various factors such as seasonal changes, regular habits, the use of virilifying preparations, and even one's natural disposition.

To address these variations in sexual vitality, Ayurvedic medicine offers a range of treatments to enhance reproductive health. These include purification through niruha and anuvasana enemas, followed by the administration of semen-promoting preparations made from ghee, oil, meat juice, milk, sugar, and honey. Consuming milk and meat juice during this therapy is also recommended to further support reproductive health and vitality."

Then it should be mixed with one fourth in quantity of sharkara, tugakshiri, honey, ikshuraka, pippali and ajada. The pills of the size of fruit of udumbara should be made out of this preparation. By taking these pills, the person gets excited like a kulinga (sparrow).[30-32]","In the ancient text, a precise formula is described for creating a medicinal mixture using ghee and various other ingredients. First, one patra of ghee should be cooked in 100 times the quantity of vidari juice. The mixture is then combined with an equal measure of cow's milk and simmered further. Once prepared, the concoction is mixed with a combination of sharkara, tugakshiri, honey, ikshuraka, pippali, and ajada in quantities equal to one fourth of the original ghee amount. The resulting mixture is formed into pills resembling the size of a udumbara fruit. Upon ingesting these medicinal pills, the individual is said to experience excitement and increased energy, similar to that of a kulinga (sparrow)."
1015,"One hundred palas of sitopala, 50 palas of freshly collected ghee, and 25 palas of honey should be cooked together with 25 palas of water till it becomes thickened. After that it should be mixed with 25 palas of wheat flour and the paste then prepared should be spread over a clean and smooth stone slab. It should be kneaded by repeatedly spreading it. After that, utkarikas which are round and shining like moon, should be prepared. By taking these utkarikas, man becomes capable of doing sexual act in an elephant’s vigor. [33-35]","In ancient texts, there exists a fascinating Sanskrit verse that provides guidance on preparing a unique concoction using sitopala, fresh ghee, honey, wheat flour, and water. The recipe instructs one to cook these ingredients together until they thicken into a paste, which should then be spread over a smooth stone slab and kneaded repeatedly. According to the verse, consuming this mixture, in the form of small round utkarikas, can grant one the sexual prowess of an elephant. While it is essential to approach such claims with skepticism, understanding these ancient practices offers valuable insights into historical beliefs and customs surrounding health and vitality."
1016,"Any article which is sweet, unctuous, life promoting, nourishing and heavy to digest and causing mental excitement, is to be regarded as virilific. ","In the context of diet and well-being, it is important to consider the qualities of the food we consume. According to Sanskrit scholars, food that is sweet, unctuous, life-promoting, nourishing, and heavy to digest, but also causes mental excitement, is classified as ""virilific."" This term describes a type of sustenance that may be satisfying and beneficial in some ways, but could potentially lead to imbalances or excesses in the body and mind if consumed in large quantities. Understanding these qualities can help us make more informed choices about our diet and overall health."
1017,"Therefore, a person, first of all be impregnated with these articles, should approach for his woman. He gets excited by his own urge and also by the erotic attributes of the woman. ","In order to cultivate a healthy and fulfilling relationship, it is essential to internalize and understand the teachings related to human behavior and desires. According to ancient Sanskrit texts, a person should familiarize themselves with these principles before seeking a partner. The attraction between two individuals is ignited not only by their personal desires but also by the allure of the other's erotic qualities. This balance of internal and external factors sets the stage for a harmonious and passionate connection."
1018,"After the sex act, the man should take bath and drink milk or meat juice and then go to sleep. By doing this, his semen and strength get replenished. An unblossomed bud does not possess fragrance but fragrance appears when it blossoms. Similar phenomenon takes place in case of semen of the living beings. ","In the aftermath of intimacy, a man is advised to cleanse his body with a bath and replenish his energy with nourishing substances such as milk or meat juice before seeking repose. This practice is believed to restore both semen and strength. Interestingly, this phenomenon can be likened to that of a flower bud, which may not possess fragrance in its unexposed state, yet unveils its scent once it blooms. Similarly, the true potency and power of an individual's semen are only revealed and rejuvenated through abiding by this ancient wisdom."
1019,"It is not proper for a man, desirous of longevity, to enter in to sexual intercourse with woman when he is under sixteen or over seventy yrs. of age. ","In the quest for prolonging life, it is crucial to follow certain guidelines, as stated in ancient Sanskrit texts. One such guideline advises men, who wish to live a long and healthy life, to refrain from sexual intercourse with women during two specific age groups. The first group being men under the age of sixteen, and the second being those over the age of seventy. By adhering to this advice, one can potentially increase their lifespan and maintain overall well-being."
1020,"If a young boy of very tender age whose body elements are not yet fully formed, enters in to sex act with a woman, his body gets dried up like a pond having very little water. ","In the exploration of ancient wisdom, a striking observation is made in Sanskrit texts regarding the consequences of sexual activity in young boys. It is said that if a child, whose physical elements are still in the process of formation, engages in intimate relations with a woman, his body's vitality and resources get depleted, compared to a pond with scant water. This analogy underscores the significance of age and physiological development in sexual activities, emphasizing the potential harm that early exposure could bring."
1021,"Dried, sapless piece of wood, eaten by worms and has become porous, gets broken immediately by a little pressure. Similarly, the body of the old man gets decayed by sexual intercourse with a woman. ","The wisdom of ancient Sanskrit verses continues to resonate even today, offering profound insights into human nature and the cycle of life. One such verse likens the aged, sapless wood, riddled with worms and porous, to the frailty of an elderly person's body. Just as the slightest pressure can cause such wood to break apart, so too does sexual intercourse with a woman weaken and hasten the decay of an old man's body. This powerful metaphor reminds us of the fragility of life and serves as a reminder to treat our bodies with care and respect, particularly as we age."
1022,"The semen gets diminished by old age, worry, anxiety, diseases, overexertion, fasting and excessive sexual indulgence. ","According to ancient Sanskrit texts, there are several factors that can lead to a decrease in semen, a vital fluid associated with male reproductive health. These factors include advanced age, as the natural production of this fluid wanes over time. Additionally, emotional states such as worry and anxiety can also contribute to its diminishment. Furthermore, illnesses, overexertion, and extended fasting are also cited as causes. Lastly, engaging in excessive sexual activity is believed to deplete this fluid, indicating the importance of balance and moderation in all aspects of life."
1023,"By consumption, fear, suspicion and grief, by seeing the deformities in woman, by non excitation of the woman, absence of passionate determination, by abstention from sex and just after full sexual enjoyment, a man is rendered incapable of mating with a woman. This depends on strength of the body and mind.[36-45]","In the context of human biology and psychology, a number of factors can contribute to a person's ability or inability to engage in sexual activity. According to a Sanskrit verse, these factors include one's diet, fear, suspicion, grief, and even the act of observing physical imperfections in a potential partner. Additionally, a lack of mental and physical stimulation, as well as the decision to abstain from sex or engage in it to the point of exhaustion, can also play a role. Ultimately, the verse suggests that a person's capacity for sexual activity is influenced by the strength of both their body and mind."
1024,"As the juice exists in the sugarcane, ghee in the whole curd, and oil exists in whole part of the sesame seed, in the same way, semen pervades in the entire body which has the sensation of touch.  ","In the same way that the sweet nectar is inherent within every fiber of the sugarcane, or ghee is found within each creamy morsel of curd, and sesame oil saturates every bit of its parent seed – so too does semen course through the entirety of the human body, finding expression in our capacity for touch and sensation. Just as these substances are inseparable from their respective sources, so is semen an integral part of our very being, shaping our physical experiences and connecting us intimately with the natural world."
1025,"The semen trickles down from its site during copulation between man and woman because of sex act, passionate attachment, and physical pressure, as water comes out of a wet cloth when squeezed. ","In the complex and often mysterious realm of human physiology, there exists a fascinating parallel that sheds light on the workings of the body during intimacy. According to Sanskrit scholars, an ancient verse likens the flow of semen in a man during copulation to the way water seeps out of a damp cloth when squeezed. This analogy delves into the idea that just as water is released from a wet fabric due to external pressure, the male reproductive fluid is discharged as a result of three primary factors: the physical act of intercourse, emotional attraction, and the simple force of bodily contact between two individuals."
1026,"The semen is ejaculated from the body as a result of these eight factors- excitement, excessive desire, fluidity, viscosity, heaviness, atomicity and the tendency to flow out and the speedy motion of vata. The un-manifested soul which takes different forms in this world, manifests itself in the form of semen.[46-49]","In the ancient wisdom of Sanskrit, it is believed that the human body produces semen as a result of eight distinct factors. These include excitement, intense desire, fluidity, viscosity, heaviness, and atomicity, along with the natural tendency for it to flow out and the quick motion of vata. According to this philosophy, the unmanifested soul that appears in various forms in the world takes on the shape of semen during this process. This profound concept highlights the significance of self-control and moderation, even at a biological level."
1027,"The semen which is thick, sweet, unctuous, without any putrid smell, heavy, viscid, white in color, and abundant in quantity, invariably helps in procreation. This is undoubtful about the semen.[50]","The qualities of semen are crucial to its role in procreation, as described in this Sanskrit verse. When it is thick, sweet, and unctuous, with a heavy viscosity and pure white color, it is most conducive to the process of creating life. Furthermore, an abundant quantity of such semen, free from putrid smells, greatly enhances the possibility of successful conception. This ancient wisdom underscores the importance of these specific characteristics in the broader context of human reproduction."
1028,"That process, which make a man capable of copulation with woman frequently and for a long time with stallion vigor, is called Vajikarana.[51]","The concept of Vajikarana, as described in ancient Sanskrit texts, refers to the practice or process that enhances a man's sexual prowess. Specifically, it enables a man to engage in intimate relations with his partner more frequently and for extended periods, while maintaining the stamina and vigor comparable to that of a stallion. This traditional Indian medical approach aims to promote overall reproductive health and improve the quality of life by balancing various elements of the human body."
1029,"To sum up-  In this quarter, called Pumanajata Baladika, the purpose for which the virilifying preparations have been prescribed along with twelve excellent virilific recipes. Things which are to be taken before and after the intercourse; the time when women are not fit to be approached for sex and the determination of the semen in every aspect and the definition of Vajikarana have also been described in this quarter.[52-53]","The Pumanajata Baladika quarter delves into the topic of virilification, providing 12 exceptional recipes to aid in this process. It also offers guidance on what to consume before and after intercourse, as well as identifying when women are not suitable for sexual activity. Additionally, it explains how to identify semen in detail and provides a comprehensive definition of Vajikarana. This section serves as a valuable resource for those seeking knowledge about these crucial aspects of human life."
1030,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Atisara chikitsa"" (Management of diarrhea and associated disorders). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the vast expanse of ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, Lord Atreya takes us through a journey of understanding and managing one of the most common health issues - diarrhea and its related disorders. The ""Atisara Chikitsa"" chapter, as mentioned in the scriptures, is now our focus. Through this exploration, we aim to shed light on the Ayurvedic approach to treating and preventing Atisara, providing valuable insights into this age-old medical system."
1031,"The patient who has not yet reached the stage of absolute incurability should be properly treated after the examination of causative factors, upashaya (pacifying factors) and nature of the aggravation of specific dosha. In this condition, the most aggravated dosha should be treated in the beginning followed by the treatment of the other less aggravated dosha. [10]","In the realm of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, it is essential to provide proper treatment to patients who still hold the potential for cure. This can be achieved by identifying and addressing the root causes of the ailment, along with any pacifying factors and the severity of aggravated doshas (the three energies that govern all biological functions). The most heightened dosha should receive priority in treatment, followed by subsequent attention to less intensified doshas. This sequential approach ensures a comprehensive and effective healing process, enabling the patient to regain their balance and health."
1032,"The exogenous type of atisara (diarrhea) is of mental origin and is of two types. One of these is caused by fear and the other is caused by grief. Their signs and symptoms are similar to those of the vatika type of atisara. Thus atisara or diarrhea is of two types, viz., nija or endogenous (like vataja, pittaja, kaphaja and sannipataja atisara and agantuja/manasa or exogenous [11]","In the ancient medical text of Ayurveda, diarrhea or Atisara is classified into two primary categories - endogenous and exogenous. The exogenous type, known as agantuja or manasa, has its origins in the mind. It is further divided into two subcategories: fear-induced and grief-induced. Interestingly, these types exhibit symptoms similar to the vatika type of Atisara. This classification highlights the importance of considering both physical and psychological factors in diagnosing and treating diarrhea in Ayurvedic medicine."
1033,The following therapies help to cure agantuja/manasa or exogenous: Both fear and grief causes aggravation of vata instantaneously. Vata alleviating drugs and therapies should be administered for the treatment of exogenous atisara. The patient suffering from diarrhea caused by fear (bhayaja) should be exhilarated.  The patient suffering from diarrhea caused by shoka (grief) should be consoled [12-13],"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, exogenous diarrhea, or ""atisara,"" can be traced back to two primary sources: fear and grief. Both of these emotional states have the potential to aggravate vata, one of the three fundamental energies in the body, almost immediately. To address this type of atisara, it is recommended that therapies aimed at alleviating vata be administered. In situations where diarrhea is caused specifically by fear, the patient may benefit from measures designed to uplift their spirits and foster a sense of calm. Conversely, if grief is the root cause, providing comfort and emotional support becomes the central focus of treatment. Through careful attention to these emotional factors and judicious use of vata-reducing therapies, it is possible to effectively manage and overcome exogenous diarrhea in Ayurvedic practice.

1034,"The following principles of treatment are used in management of atisara:  When the diarrhea is caused by the accumulated (aggravated) dosha impelled by vidagdha (fermentation of undigested) food, the patient should be given laxative to eliminate the dosha. ","In the Ayurvedic management of atisara, or diarrhea, one key principle is to identify the root cause, which is often the accumulation and aggravation of doshas in the system. When the diarrhea is a result of a dosha impelled by vidagdha, or fermentation of undigested food, a laxative may be administered to help eliminate the dosha from the system. This is a fundamental concept in Ayurvedic treatment, where like is treated with like, and elimination is seen as a means to restore balance and promote healing."
1035,"In the initial state i.e. ama (primary or immature) of diarrhea, stopping or binding therapies are never indicated. ","When it comes to managing diarrhea in its primary form, also known as ama, Ayurvedic principles suggest that binding or stopping therapies should be avoided. This stage of diarrhea is characterized by the immature and raw state of the digestive process, and any intervention aimed at halting it may lead to further complications. Instead, supportive care and nourishment are recommended to aid the body's natural healing processes."
1036,"Administration of such bowel-binding therapies in the initial stage obstructs the movement and elimination of the already aggravated dosha leading to complications like dandakalasaka (obstruction to intestinal peristalsis), adhmana (flatulence), grahani roga (digestive disorders like sprue syndrome), piles, fistula-in-ano, edema, anemia, splenic disorders, kushtha (obstinate skin diseases including leprosy), gulma (abdominal lumps), udara roga (obstinate abdominal diseases including ascites) and fever. Hence, the physician should ignore the downward movement of the detached (utklishta) morbid matter, which is moving downwards on its own. Diarrhea should be allowed to continue and should not be stopped by constipating medicines. ","The administration of bowel-binding therapies at the early stages of medical treatment can have severe consequences, according to Ayurvedic teachings. When the body's doshas are already aggravated, these remedies can obstruct their movement and elimination, leading to a range of complications. These include intestinal obstruction, flatulence, digestive disorders, piles, fistula, edema, anemia, splenic issues, stubborn skin diseases, abdominal lumps, persistent abdominal ailments, and fever. Therefore, it is advisable for physicians to refrain from interfering with the natural downward movement of detached morbid matter and allow diarrhea to continue without using constipating medicines."
1037,"If the diarrhea is associated with griping pain (difficulty in evacuating), then haritaki should be given as a mild laxative. Once the morbid matter is eliminated through downward movement then this abdominal disease (diarrhea) gets cured, the body becomes light and the power of agni becomes strong. Moderately aggravated dosha should be managed by pramathya (a type of decoction of drugs) which stimulates the power of digestion (dipana) and which is carminative (pachana) should be administered. Slightly aggravated dosha should be managed by langhana (fasting therapy) [14-19].","The ancient medical science of Ayurveda offers a time-tested solution for managing diarrhea with griping pain. The Sanskrit verse recommends the use of haritaki as a mild laxative to help eliminate morbid matter from the body, thereby curing the disease and making the body light. For moderately aggravated dosha, or bodily humors, a decoction of drugs that stimulates digestion and is carminative should be administered. In cases of slight aggravation, fasting therapy can help manage the condition [14-19]. These traditional practices, when followed correctly, can provide relief from symptoms while strengthening the body's power of digestion and agni."
1038,"Three recipes of pramathya which are useful in the treatment of diarrhea are as follow:  Decoction of pippali, nagara, dhanyaka, bhutika, abhaya and vacha for vataja atisara Decoction of hrivera, bhadra-musta, bilva, nagara and dhanyaka for pittaja atisara) Decoction of prashniparni, svadamstra, samanga and kantakarika for kaphaja atisara Decoction of vacha and prativisha for vataja atisara Decoction of musta and parpataka for pittaja atisara Decoction of hrivera and sringavera for kaphaja atisara  [Note: Decoction should be prepared as per the procedure described for sandanga-paniya in C.S.Ci.3-145.] [20-22]","In traditional Ayurvedic medicine, diarrhea or ""atisara"" is classified into three types based on the dominant dosha (Vata, Pitta, or Kapha) involved. For Vataja atisara, a decoction of pippali, nagara, dhanyaka, bhutika, abhaya, and vacha is recommended. In contrast, for Pittaja atisara, a mixture of hrivera, bhadra-musta, bilva, nagara, and dhanyaka is used. For Kaphaja atisara, prashniparni, svadamstra, samanga, and kantakarika are combined in a decoction. Additionally, there are specific recipes for managing diarrhea caused by the aggravation of two or more doshas. These ancient Ayurvedic formulations, prepared as per the procedure described for sandanga-paniya in C.S.Ci.3-145, still hold relevance and offer a natural approach to treating diarrhea."
1039,"At appropriate meal time, if the patient feels hungry, light food should be given to eat. It enhances the appetite and stimulates agni and as a result the strength is promoted immediately. Depending upon the wholesomeness (satmya) of the patient, light food along with buttermilk or kanji (a sour drink), yavagu (thick gruel), tarpana (roasted flour of serials mixed with water), or alcoholic drink or honey should be given. Then gradually yavagu (thick gruel), vilepi (a sticky gruel), khanda (a sour appetiser), yusha (vegetable soup) and boiled rice mixed with meat soup which are prepared by adding digestive, stimulants and astringent (constipative) drugs should be given. Ingredients which are dipana (digestive stimulant) and grahi (constipating) are described in [Cha. Sa. Sutra Sthana 4/9 ] should be administered [23-25]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, it is advised that at proper meal times, a patient who experiences hunger should be served light and easily digestible food. This type of fare not only increases the appetite but also boosts agni, the digestive fire, leading to an immediate improvement in strength. The specific type of light food given can vary based on the patient's individual tolerances and wholesomeness (satmya). For example, they may be given buttermilk or kanji (a sour drink), yavagu (thick gruel), tarpana (roasted flour of serials mixed with water), or even an alcoholic drink or honey. As the patient's strength improves, their diet can gradually be increased to include more substantial fare such as yavagu (thick gruel), vilepi (a sticky gruel), khanda (a sour appetizer), yusha (vegetable soup) and boiled rice mixed with meat soup. These foods should be prepared with digestive stimulants, astringents, and other drugs as described in Cha. Sa. Sutra Sthana 4/9 to further aid in the digestion and assimilation process."
1040,"The following drugs are useful for the cure of vataja atisara(diarrhea):  Shalaparni, prashniparni, brhati, kantakarika, bala, svadamstra, bilva, patha, nagara, dhanyaka, shati, palasha, hapusha, vacha, jiraka, pippali, yavani, pippali-mula, chitraka, hastipippali, vrikshamla, sour pomegranate, hingu, vida and saindhava-these ingredients should be appropriately used in processing food preparations. Drugs belonging to the vata and kapha' alleviative group and those drugs which are dipana (digestive stimulant), pachana (carminative), grahi (constipating), balya (promoter of strength) and rochana (appetizer) should be prescribed. [26-29]","In the context of managing vataja atisara, or diarrhea, Ayurvedic medicine offers a range of natural remedies to alleviate its symptoms.

These herbs and spices should be skillfully incorporated into food preparations to enhance their therapeutic value. Furthermore, drugs that mitigate vata and kapha doshas, as well as those with digestive stimulant, carminative, constipating, strength-promoting, and appetizing properties, are recommended for optimal results."
1041,"After the maturity of ama (product of indigestion), if the patient experiences loose motions along with scybalous feces associated with colic pain and mucus very frequently in small quantities, and if there is griping pain, then he should be given food along with the soup of mulaka, badara, upodikā, kshirini, yavāni, vāstuka, suvarchala, chanchu (nadika), leaves of avalguja, shati, karkaruka, jivanti, chirbhata (karkati), lonika, patha or shushka-shaka (kasamarda according to Chakrapani). These soups should be cooked along with curd (yogurt) and dadima, and added with ghee in copious quantities [30-33]","In the management of certain digestive disorders, as outlined in a traditional Sanskrit text, particular attention is given to the symptoms of frequent, watery bowel movements accompanied by undigested food particles, abdominal pain, and mucus discharge. The recommended remedy for this condition involves the consumption of soups prepared from specific ingredients such as mulaka, badara, upodikā, kshirini, yavāni, vāstuka, suvarchala, chanchu (also known as nadika), leaves of avalguja, shati, karkaruka, jivanti, chirbhata (or karkati), lonika, patha, or shushka-shaka (kasamarda according to Chakrapani). These soups should be prepared with curd and dadima and generously supplemented with ghee for optimal benefit."
1042,"The following khada (a sour appetizer) cures pravahika (dysentery):  It is prepared by adding the paste of tender fruits of bilva, equal quantities of the paste of sesame, cream of sour curd and copious quantities of ghee [34].","In the realm of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, a remarkable preparation known as khada holds the potential to alleviate the discomforting condition of dysentery, also known as pravahika. This wholesome remedy is concocted through the blending of several ingredients, including the paste of tender bilva fruits and an equal measure of sesame paste. To these are added generous amounts of creamy sour curd and copious quantities of ghee. This unique combination yields a sour appetizer that Ayurvedic practitioners have turn to for its potential healing properties and soothing effects on the digestive system."
1043,"If there is varcha-kshaya (scanty stool), then the patient should be given the following recipes:  If there is varcha-kshaya (scanty stool) and dryness of the mouth, then the patient should be given dhanya-yusha (a type of soup prepared of cereals and pulses) made of yava, mudga, masha, and shali type of rice, sesame seeds, kola and tender fruits of bilva, sizzled with yamaka (ghee and oil) taken together with curd and the extract of dadima. One should take boiled shāli rice along with this soup.

For those experiencing both scanty stool and dryness of the mouth, a soup made of yava, mudga, masha, and shali rice, along with sesame seeds, kola, tender bilva fruits, sizzled with a mixture of ghee and oil, is recommended. This dhanya-yusha soup, when consumed with curd and the extract of dadima (raisen), and boiled shāli rice, provides relief from the discomfort caused by varcha-kshaya. Additionally, other soups like those made of granjanaka, lopaka, kachchapa, barhi, tittiri, daksha or vartaka meats, sizzled with ghee and oil, sour ingredients, and jaggery are suggested as side-dishes. The red variety of shali rice boiled in a soup made of sheep's trunk meat, blood, extract of dadima, dhanya (spices), ghee, nagara, and sour ingredients serves as an effective remedy for varcha-kshaya. The consumption of this cooked rice and the intake of this soup ensure the patient's recovery from the ailments caused by scanty stool."
1044,"If there is prolapse of rectum and colic pain, and if the diarrhea is free from ama, then the patient should be given medicated ghee prepared with sour drugs or anuvasana (unctuous enema). [42]","The ancient medical text, the Sushruta Samhita, offers guidance for specific digestive ailments. In cases of rectal prolapse and abdominal pain, accompanied by free-flowing diarrhea that is not loaded with undigested food residue (ama), the recommended treatment is a specialized enema.

Medicated ghee, when used in this anuvasana procedure, delivers potent benefits to aid in managing these uncomfortable symptoms."
1045,"Ghee should be cooked with the juice of changeri, decoction of kola and sour curd, and the paste of nagara and kshara (alkali preparation). Intake of this medicated ghee cures ailments caused by prolapse of rectum.

As per Ayurvedic texts, its consumption brings about significant improvements in overall health and digestive system efficiency."
1046,"Ghee should be cooked with the sour ingredients (juice of changeri, decoction of kola and sour curd), and the pastes of chavya, pippali-mula, shunthi, pippali, maricha, vida and dadima. Intake of this medicated ghee should be done along with dhanya, ajaji and chitraka in appropriate quantities (for curing prolapse of rectum)  Thus, ends the description of chavyadi -ghrita for prolapsed rectum [44].","The traditional Ayurvedic text recommends a unique formulation, known as Chavyadi-ghrita, as a treatment for prolapse of the rectum.

1047,"For the cure of prolapse rectum, anuvasana basti (oil-based enema therapy) should be administered with the following recipes:  Dashamoola cooked with fat; Bilva cooked with fat: Shati, shatahva or bilva cooked in fat; Vacha cooked with fat; and Chitraka cooked with fat [45].","In the Ayurvedic practice, an oil-based enema therapy known as Anuvasana Basti is recommended for the treatment of rectal prolapse. This therapeutic approach involves the administration of enema made from potent herbal recipes. The Dashamoola decoction, prepared by cooking selected ten roots in fat, is one such recipe. Similarly, Bilva, Shati, or Erandamula are cooked in fat, as well as Vacha and Chitraka, which also undergo the same process. These enema recipes, when administered, help to nourish and rejuvenate the tissues, thereby reducing the rectal prolapse symptomatology, according to Ayurvedic literature [45]."
1048,"If the prolapsed rectum becomes stiff or strangulated, and does not go inside of its own, then oil should be applied over it and fomentation should be given. Thereafter, when the prolapsed rectum is well fomented and has become soft, then with the help of a cotton pad (or pad made of thick cloth) it should be pushed inside and restored to its original place [46].","In the context of addressing a stiff or strangulated prolapsed rectum that is unable to retract on its own, ancient Ayurvedic texts recommend a course of treatment that involves applying oil and providing fomentation to the affected area. Once the prolapsed rectum has softened and become more pliable as a result of the fomentation, a cotton or thick cloth pad can be used to gently guide it back into its original position. This time-tested approach harnesses the healing power of natural therapies to promote the body's own restorative abilities."
1049,"If the movement of flatus and stool is blocked(constipated), if the patient suffers from various kinds of pain, if the patient passes blood and mucus, and if the patient is thirsty, then adequate quantity of milk should be administered. Such a patient should be given yamaka (ghee and oil mixed together), and thereafter, lukewarm milk collected directly from the udder (dharoshna).  Milk boiled with the root of castor or tender fruit of bilva may also be given in the above mentioned condition. By the intake of the recipes of medicated ghee mentioned above, bleeding and mucus discharge from the anus stops. These recipes also cure colic pain, dysentery and constipation [47-49]","The Sanskrit verse recommends the use of milk and medicated ghee as a remedy for specific health conditions. In cases where a patient experiences blockage of flatus and stool, suffers from various types of pain, passes blood and mucus, and feels thirsty, administering an adequate quantity of milk is advised. Furthermore, the verse suggests that the patient should be given yamaka, a mixture of ghee and oil, followed by lukewarm milk from the udder or milk boiled with the root of castor or tender fruit of bilva. These remedies, particularly the recipes of medicated ghee, are believed to stop bleeding and mucus discharge from the anus while also alleviating colic pain, dysentery, and constipation."
1050,"The following recipes are useful in curing pittaja atisara:  The fruit and bark of vatsaka should be added with ativisha and honey. It should be taken along with rice-water (tandulodaka). The following recipes should be taken along with honey and rice-water (tandulodaka).  Powder of kiratatiktaka, musta, vatsaka and rasanjana. Powder of bilva, dāruharidra, tvak, hribera and duralabha Powder of chandana, mranāla, nagara, lodhra and utpala Powder of tila, mocha-rasa, lodhra, samanga, kamala and utpala Powder of utpala, dhataki(flower), dadima,tvak and mahaushadha Katphala, nagara, patha, seed-pulp of jambu and amra, and duralabha. ","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, there are specific recipes that are recommended for curing ""pittaja atisara,"" a type of digestive disorder. These remedies include a variety of natural ingredients, each with their own unique medicinal properties. For example, the fruit and bark of the vatsaka tree, along with ativisha and honey, are said to be beneficial when taken with rice-water. Similarly, powders made from combinations of herbs such as kiratatiktaka, musta, vatsaka, rasanjana, bilva, dāruharidra, tvak, hribera, duralabha, chandana, mranāla, nagara, lodhra, utpala, tila, mocha-rasa, samanga, kamala, dhataki, dadima, patha, jambu, amra, and duralabha are also recommended. These powders should be taken with honey and rice-water for maximum effect."
1051,"Once the above mentioned recipes are digested, the patient should be given to eat red variety of rice harvested in earlier seasons, along with appropriately cooked meat-soup added with constipating drugs [51-56]","In following the traditional Indian medical scriptures, a carefully curated diet is advised post the consumption of specific therapeutic recipes. Once these remedial concoctions are digested, patients are recommended to consume the red variety of earlier season's rice. This is to be complemented with properly cooked meat soup, which is then combined with constipating medicinal drugs. The intention behind this regimen is to ensure gradual restoration of the patient's natural digestive functions while providing necessary nutrition in a controlled and monitored manner."
1052,"Goat-milk administered to a patient having strong power of digestion cures pittaja atisara and promotes strength as well as complexion. Due to excessive aggravation of dosha, if the pittaja atisara is not cured and if the patient has strong power of digestion and vitality, then laxative therapy with milk should be given. ","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, it is believed that goat-milk holds a special place in treating certain health conditions. Particularly, for patients with robust digestive power, goat-milk can work wonders in managing pittaja atisara, an ailment characterized by loose stools due to aggravation of Pitta dosha. Consuming goat-milk not only helps cure this condition but also enhances strength and complexion. However, in severe cases where the imbalance of doshas remains unchecked, laxative therapy with milk might be recommended for individuals with strong digestive vitality."
1053,"Decoction of the fruit of palasha along with milk should be given. Later, depending upon the strength of the patient, lukewarm milk should be given. This will restore bowel movement and control the atisara. Decoction of trayamana along with milk should be given. Later, depending upon the strength of the patient lukewarm milk should be given. This will restore bowel movement and control the atisara. Anuvasana basti (medicated untuous enema):  During the course of sansarjana-krama (gradual administration of light food) after purification therapy if the colic pain persists, then anuvasana basti therapy should be administered immediately because morbid matter is already eliminated. Satapushpadi ghee is advised for anuvasana basti [57-62].","In the context of managing atisara, an ancient Ayurvedic text recommends a decoction made from the fruit of palasha, mixed with milk, to help restore bowel movements. This treatment should be followed with lukewarm milk, depending on the patient's strength. Similarly, a decoction of trayamana, also combined with milk, can be used for the same purpose. As part of the sansarjana-krama, or the gradual reintroduction of food after purification therapy, anuvasana basti therapy may be administered if colic pain persists. Here, Satapushpadi ghee is suggested as a suitable option for the enema. These time-tested remedies reflect Ayurveda's holistic approach to healthcare, offering a unique and culturally rich perspective on disease management."
1054,"If diarrhea persists in spite of the administration of anuvasana basti and observing the samsarjana-krama (gradual administration of lighter to heavier food) then piccha basti (mucilaginous type of medicated enema) should be given.  Green stalks of shalmali should be covered with green kusha and tied. This bundle is then smeared with the mud of black soil and placed over cow-dung fire. After the mud is dried up, the stalks of shalmali is removed. These stalks are then triturated in a pestle and mortar. One mushti (pala or handful) of this paste should be mixed with one prastha of boiled milk and filtered. In this milk, oil, ghee and paste of madhuka are added in adequate quantity. This recipe is used for the medicated enema to be given to the patient after massaging the body with oil. When the nasty material comes out, the patient should take bath and thereafter take food along with either milk or the meat soup of the wild animals. ","The administration of anuvasana basti and adherence to a samsarjana-krama may not always alleviate persistent diarrhea, as stated in this Sanskrit verse. In such cases, the text suggests a more specialized treatment - the piccha basti. This unique enema preparation involves the creation of a bundle from green stalks of shalmali, covered with kusha and dried over cow-dung fire. Once the stalks are triturated and mixed with boiled milk, filtered, and combined with appropriate quantities of oil, ghee, and madhuka paste, this concoction is used for the enema treatment. After the removal of waste materials, a bath is recommended, followed by food consumption accompanied by either milk or the soup of wild animals. This comprehensive approach emphasizes the importance of tailored treatments in Ayurvedic medicine to address specific health concerns."
1055,"This piccha-basti (mucilaginous enema) cures paittika type of diarrhea, fever, edema, gulma (abdominal lumps), chronic diarrhea, grahani (digestive disorders) and the acute complications of purgation as well as of asthapana basti [63-68]","The ancient practice of piccha-basti, a type of mucilaginous enema, has been identified in Sanskrit texts as a holistic treatment for various medical conditions. According to these sources, this therapy is particularly effective in curing paittika diarrhea, a specific type characterized by digestive disorders and chronic ailments. Additionally, it is also known to provide relief from fever, edema, and abdominal lumps. The therapeutic benefits of piccha-basti extend further, as it is also recommended for managing the acute complications arising from both purgation and asthapana basti procedures. This ancient medical practice, therefore, offers a multi-faceted approach to addressing various health concerns, as outlined in traditional Sanskrit texts."
1056,"If a pittaja atisara patient does not follow the therapeutic measures and resorts to such foods and drinks which cause aggravation of pitta, then the excessively provoked pitta causes raktatisara and instantaneous vitiation of rakta (blood). ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, it is crucial for a pittaja atisara patient to adhere to prescribed therapeutic measures. A failure to do so and indulging in foods and drinks that exacerbate pitta can lead to severe consequences. The excessively aggravated pitta can give rise to raktatisara, a condition characterized by the bleeding of rakta or blood. This instantaneous vitiation of blood can be potentially dangerous and highlights the importance of following a recommended diet and lifestyle in Ayurvedic treatment."
1057,"This leads to serious complications like morbid thirst, colic pain, burning sensation and suppuration of the anus. It can also manifest itself directly on account of excessive aggravation of pitta and vitiation of blood [69-70]","The malignant effects of imbalanced Pitta and vitiated blood can result in severe health complications, as described in this Sanskrit verse. These consequences include morbid thirst, intense abdominal pain akin to colic, a burning sensation in the body, and suppuration or pus formation in the anus. Moreover, these symptoms can also emerge directly from an extreme aggravation of Pitta and impaired blood, leading to significant health risks. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a healthy balance of doshas and ensure proper blood circulation in the body."
1058,"For the treatment of raktatisara, the following therapy should be administered:  Goat’s milk is very useful. It should be used, when cooled, with honey and sugar for drink, along with food, and for washing the anal region. ","In the Ayurvedic treatment of raktatisara, goat's milk holds a prominent place. This soothing dairy product, when cooled, is often combined with honey and sugar to create a medicinal drink. Moreover, it is also recommended to incorporate goat's milk into one's diet and utilize it for washing the anal region, providing a holistic approach to managing this condition."
1059,"Goat’s milk along with the boiled rice of red variety of shali should be given. The boiled rice may also be given along with the soup of the meat of paravata, etc., sizzled with ghee and mixed with sugar. The soup of the meat having cooling effect like that of rabbits, birds and deer inhabiting deserts should be sizzled with ghee, mixed with sugar should be given. It may be ensured that these soups are free from any sour ingredients. ","In the healing process, traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, recommends specific diets to complement the treatment. For those recovering from illness, Goat's milk along with red Shali rice is advised. Alternatively, boiled rice can be served with the soup of animals like the partridge, prepared in ghee and sweetened with sugar. Another option includes consuming soups derived from desert-dwelling rabbits, birds, and deer, which have a cooling effect. It's crucial that these soups are prepared carefully, excluding any sour components, to ensure the recovery process is not disrupted."
1060,"The blood of deer or goat, sizzled with ghee is also very useful. The soup of the fruits of kashmarya, made slightly sour and mixed with sugar should be given. The powder of nilotpala, mocharasa, samanga and padmakeshara should be administered along with the goat’s milk. After the digestion of this potion, the patient should be given rice with milk. If the patient is weak, then food can be given to him even before the above mentioned potion is digested. Butter along with honey and sugar may be given before meals [71-76].","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, the preparation of a healing concoction from natural ingredients is highly recommended for various ailments. According to a Sanskrit verse translation, the blood of a deer or goat, sizzled in ghee, holds great therapeutic value. A fruit soup of kashmarya, slightly soured and sweetened, should also be consumed. Furthermore, a mixture of nilotpala, mocharasa, samanga, and padmakeshara powders with goat's milk is advised. Once this potion is digested, rice with milk should follow as the next meal. If the patient's strength is significantly low, food can be given prior to the complete digestion of the initial concoction. To provide additional energy, a mixture of butter, honey, and sugar may be given before meals."
1061,"After taking ghee collected from the cream of milk along with milk, the patient should take the meat soup of kapinjala. During this therapy, he should take milk in adequate quantity. It cures raktatisara in three days. While consuming milk as food (drink), the patient should take the paste of shatavari mixed with milk. He may also take ghee boiled with the paste of shatavari. Consumption of ghee cooked by adding the paste of fruits of kutaja, along with the scum (upper part) of yavagu, and followed by intake of peya (thin gruel) is advised [77-79].","The Sanskrit verse recommends a unique therapy for treating raktatisara, a type of digestive disorder. The treatment involves consuming ghee collected from milk cream along with milk and meat soup from kapinjala birds. It is advised to consume milk in adequate quantities throughout this therapy, which should last for three days. Additionally, the patient should consume the paste of shatavari mixed with milk or ghee boiled with shatavari paste. To further aid recovery, ghee cooked with kutaja fruit paste and scum of yavagu should be taken, followed by thin gruel. This holistic approach, deeply rooted in Ayurvedic traditions, highlights the importance of a balanced diet and natural resources for treating various health conditions."
1062,"Ghee should be cooked by adding the six drugs, viz., the bark of daru-haridra, fruits of kutaja, pippali, shringavera, draksa and katukarohini. Intake of peya (thin gruel) and manda (very thin gruel) along with this medicated ghee cures a serious type of diarrhea even if caused by sannipata (simultaneous aggravation of all the three dosha).[80-81]","The ancient healing wisdom of Ayurveda offers a promising resolution for a severe type of diarrhea, even when triggered by the rare yet critical sannipata - the simultaneous aggravation of all three doshas. A unique concoction, prepared by simmering ghee with six potent ingredients - daru-haridra bark, kutaja fruits, pippali, shringavera, draksa, and katukarohini - has been traditionally used. According to Charaka Samhita, a foundational Ayurvedic text, consuming this medicated ghee along with peya (thin gruel) and manda (very thin gruel) can provide relief and potentially cure this debilitating condition. This ancient remedy stands as a testament to the rich and enduring legacy of Ayurveda in addressing complex health concerns."
1063,"Intake of krishnamrita (black earth), madhuka, shankha, rudhira (blood or kesara) and rice-water, mixed with honey controls bleeding instantaneously. ","In the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, a remarkable concoction is highlighted for its ability to control bleeding instantly. This mixture, known as Krishnamrita, consists of black earth, madhuka (a type of herb), shankha (conch shell), rudhira or kesara (saffron, an alternative to blood due to its healing properties), and rice-water. Honey is added to the mix to enhance its effectiveness. This powerful combination has been trusted for generations to provide instant relief in cases of excessive bleeding, offering a natural and holistic approach to health and wellness."
1064,"The paste of priyangu should be added with rice-water (tandulambu). Intake of this, while taking the soup of the meat of animals inhabiting arid zone, in food, controls bleeding instantaneously. One part of the paste of the black variety of tila should be added with four parts of sugar. Intake of this potion along with the goat’s milk checks bleeding instantaneously. ","In times of urgent need to control bleeding, traditional remedies can offer an alternative solution. According to a Sanskrit verse, consuming rice-water mixed with a paste made from priyangu plants and the dry seeds of black tila (sesame) can help stop excessive bleeding instantly. For the preparation using tila, mix one part of its paste, made from the black variety of sesame seeds, with four parts of sugar. Taking this mixture along with goat's milk provides similar benefits in controlling bleeding. These natural concoctions may provide a valuable resource for those seeking alternatives to modern medical interventions or complementary solutions."
1065,"Intake of the decoction of the seeds of vatsaka, while taking meat-soup as food, cures pittaja disorders of abdomen (jathara). ","In the realm of traditional Ayurvedic wisdom, the consumption of a particular concoction has been touted for its curative properties, particularly in addressing disorders of the abdomen caused by an imbalance in the Pitta dosha. The remedy in question involves the seeds of Vatsaka, a plant long revered in Ayurvedic medicine, being steeped in a decoction. Interestingly, this healing concoction is best consumed alongside a meat-based soup, creating a unique combination that, according to ancient texts, has the power to restore balance and health within the body."
1066,"Intake of chandana along with rice-water, mixed with sugar and honey cures burning sensation, morbid thirst, prameha and bleeding [82-86].","In the realm of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, the use of natural remedies has been revered for centuries. One such time-tested concoction is the mixture of chandana, or sandalwood, combined with rice-water, sugar, and honey. This soothing blend is known to alleviate burning sensations, morbid thirst, prameha (a group of urinary disorders), and bleeding [82-86]. The intake of this concoction provides a holistic approach to managing these health issues, embodying the essence of Ayurvedic wisdom."
1067,"Aggravated pitta suppurates the anus due to frequent evacuation of stool. The anus of such a patient should be sprinkled and applied with the following recipes which stops bleeding and pacifies suppuration and pain.  Exceedingly cold decoction of patola and madhuka Decoction of pancha-valkala (barks of nyagrodha, udumbara, ashvattha, parisa and plaksha) or sugar-cane juice. Milk or ghee of goat or cow mixed with sugar and honey. The paste of drugs mentioned above for washing (sprinkling over) the anus may be mixed with ghee and applied over the suppurated anus. The powder of the above mentioned drugs may also be used for pratisarana (dusting) over the suppurated anus. The powder of dhataki and lodhra, taken in equal quantities, may be used for dusting over the suppurated anus. If there is excessive bleeding (from the anus), the cold decoction of the above mentioned drugs should be impregnated with ghee, and sprinkled over the anal region, pelvic region, lumbar region and thighs. Excessive bleeding should be controlled with a cotton pad soaked with chandanadya-taila[Cha.Sa. Chikitsa Sthana 3-258] or satadhauta-ghrita (ghee washed with cold water for one hundred times), and the oil or ghee; squeeze this pad over the anal and pelvic regions [87-92 ½]","In cases where an aggravated pitta leads to frequent bowel movements, resulting in suppuration of the anus, Ayurveda offers a range of soothing remedies. These treatments are designed to alleviate pain, halt bleeding, and clear up suppuration. Among these, you'll find decoctions made from patola and madhuka, or a mixture of the barks of five specific trees. Sugar-cane juice, goat or cow milk, as well as ghee combined with sugar and honey, can also be used to great effect. These remedies may be applied directly to the affected area, either as a paste mixed with ghee or as a powder for dusting. For severe bleeding, consider employing a cold decoction infused with ghee and impregnated cotton pads soaked in chandanadya-taila oil or satadhauta-ghrita ghee. Gently squeeze the soaked pad over the affected anal and pelvic regions to alleviate excessive bleeding and promote healing."
1068,"When the movement of the aggravated vata (flatus) gets obstructed or moves with difficulty or seizing of vata inside the abdomen, then the patient voids blood frequently in small quantities which is associated with pain. Piccha-basti should be administered to such patients. This type of patient may also be managed by anuvasana basti given with medicated ghee prepared with prapaundarika. Because of chronic diarrhea, the anus of the patient generally becomes weak. Therefore cotton soaked in medicated ghee should be inserted into the anus frequently or anuvasana basti with medicated ghee is given [93-95½ ].","In the Ayurvedic practice, the management of specific health conditions involves the use of specialized procedures and treatments. One such treatment, known as Piccha-basti, is recommended for patients who experience frequent small quantities of blood in their stool, accompanied by abdominal pain. This condition arises when the movement of vata, or flatus, becomes obstructed or moves with difficulty within the abdomen. Another treatment option for these patients is anuvasana basti, which involves administering medicated ghee prepared with prapaundarika. This method aids in alleviating symptoms by providing lubrication and promoting the smooth movement of vata. Furthermore, chronic diarrhea often weakens the patient's anus. To address this, cotton soaked in medicated ghee can be inserted frequently or anuvasana basti with medicated ghee can be administered (93-95½)."
1069,"The aggravated vata becomes stronger in its own site in atisara patients. For the pacification of aggravated vata associated with pitta (which takes place in bloody diarrhea), basti (both the anuvasana and niruha types) is the best therapy. If bleeding takes place before evacuating the stool or after evacuation of stool (i.e., a case of raktatisara), then shatavari-ghrita [Cha.Sa. Chikitsa Sthana 30/64-69] in the form of linctus should be given. Intake of freshly collected butter along with half the quantity of sugar and one fourth quantity of honey cures the above mentioned ailments. While taking this potion, the patient should take wholesome food. Adventitious roots of nyagrodha, udumbara and ashvattha should be crushed and kept soaked in hot water for twenty four hours. Ghee should be cooked along with this water. This medicated ghee should be added with half the quantity of sugar and one fourth in quantity of honey, and taken in the form of linctus. It cures raktatisara, associated with bleeding either before or after the passing of stool [96-100½]","In the context of managing atisara, a condition characterized by severe diarrhea, the Ayurvedic text Cha.Sa. Chikitsa Sthana 30/64-69 recommends basti, in both its anuvasana and niruha forms, as the optimal treatment for vata aggravation associated with pitta. This is particularly relevant for cases of bloody diarrhea. In situations where bleeding occurs either prior to or following bowel movements, Shatavari-ghrita, a mixture of ghee and the herb Shatavari, is suggested in linctus form. Similarly, consuming fresh butter combined with sugar and honey, while maintaining a wholesome diet, can help alleviate these conditions. Moreover, soaking the adventitious roots of Nyagrodha, Udumbara, and Ashvattha trees in hot water for 24 hours, cooking ghee with this water, and then mixing it with sugar and honey to create a linctus is also recommended as an effective remedy for raktatisara, or bloody diarrhea."
1070,"A patient who has become weak because of raktatisara, if indulges in pitta-aggravating ingredients out of ignorance, then the anal sphincters gets suppurated. This is a serious condition leading to instantaneous death [101½].","The consequences of ignoring dietary precautions for a weakened patient with raktatisara can be severe. Indulging in pitta-aggravating ingredients, through ignorance or disregard for advice, may lead to a dangerous condition. This negligence can result in the suppuration of the anal sphincters, a serious symptom that can unfortunately lead to an untimely and instantaneous death. It is therefore crucial for such patients to adhere strictly to their prescribed diets to ensure a smooth recovery process.

1071,"For the cure of kaphaja atisara, following therapy and recipes should be administered:  Fasting (langhana) and carminative (pachana) therapies should be administered in the beginning. ","In addressing the ailment of kaphaja atisara, the initial course of treatment includes fasting and the implementation of carminative therapies. These techniques, known as langhana and pachana respectively, play a crucial role in eliminating excessive mucus and flatus from the body, thereby providing relief to the patient and promoting recovery. The choice of these methods is based on time-tested Ayurvedic principles that focus on restoring balance and promoting overall health and wellbeing."
1072,"The group of drugs which stimulates the power of digestion (dipana-gana) which is prescribed for the treatment of ama-atisara should be given. If the kaphaja atisara persists even after the administration of the above mentioned measures, then the patient should be given kapha alleviating therapies. The following four decoctions cure kaphaja atisara as well as promotes kayagni (power of digestion and metabolism) Decoction of bilva, karkatika, musta, abhaya and vishva-bheshaja(shunthi) Decoction of vacha, vidanga, bhutika, dhanyaka and devadaru Decoction of kushtha, ativisha, pātha, chavya and katukarohini Decoction of pippali, pippali-mula, chitraka and gajapippali Administration of the recipe containing one part each of black variety of ajaji, pachana, nagara and maricha and two parts of dhataki along with profuse quantity of lime juice. One part each of rasanjana, ativisha and fruits of kutaja, and two parts of dhataki should be added with honey and ginger. This potion should be given to drink. For the treatment of kaphaja atisara, the following four recipes should be given in the form of khada (a type of sour drink which stimulates the power of digestion). Dhataki, nagara, bilva, lodhra and padmakesara; bark of jambu, nagara, dhanya, patha, mocha-rasa and bala; samanga, dhataki, pulp of bilva and the bark of jambu and amra; and kapittha, vidanga, nagara and maricha. The above mentioned recipes should be added with the sour juice of changeri and kola and butter-milk and given to the patient after adding ghee and salt.  Intake of the pulp of kapittha along with shunthi, pippali, maricha, honey and sugar, or katphala along with honey cures diseases of digestive system (jathara). Intake of pippali along with honey, or butter-milk added with the powder of chitraka or the powder of the tender fruits of bilva cures diseases of digestive system [102-112½].","In the Ayurvedic treatment of Kaphaja atisara, the administration of certain drug concoctions plays a crucial role. If the initial measures aimed at stimulating digestive power (dipana-gana) fail to alleviate Kaphaja atisara, therapies targeting Kapha reduction are prescribed. Four distinct decoctions, including Bilva, Karkatika, Musta, Abhaya, Vishva-bheshaja (Shunthi), and others like Vacha, Vidanga, Bhutika, Dhanyaka, Devadaru, and more, are utilized to cure Kaphaja atisara while simultaneously enhancing kayagni or digestive and metabolic power. These decoctions and other concoctions are administered in the form of a sour drink (khada) with added butter-milk, ghee, and salt. Further Ayurvedic remedies for digestive system diseases involve consuming Kapittha pulp with Shunthi, Pippali, Maricha, honey, or sugar, Katphala along with honey, Pippali with honey, or butter-milk combined with Chitraka powder or tender Bilva fruit powder. (Ref: Sushruta Samhita, 102-112½)"
1073,"If the movement of vata (flatus) is obstructed resulting in colic pain and dysentery, then the patient should be given tender fruits of bilva, jaggery, oil, pippali and shunthi. Diet prepared with vata alleviating ingredients along with the vegetable soup, meat soup and khada (a type of sour drink) described under vataja atisara should be given. Sour medicated ghee like changeri ghrita or shatpala ghrita [Cha.Sa. Chikitsa Sthana 5/ 147-148 ] or (ten years) old ghee mixed with yavagu (thick gruel) and manda (thin gruel) should be given [113-116].","In the context of managing obstructed vata that leads to colic pain and dysentery, ancient Ayurvedic text Charaka Samhita suggests a particular dietary and medicinal approach. The remedy includes consuming tender fruits of bilva along with jaggery, oil, pippali, and shunthi. A special diet consisting of vata-alleviating ingredients, vegetable soup, meat soup, and khada is recommended. Moreover, the text proposes administering sour medicated ghee like changeri ghrita or shatapala ghrita, or even using (ten years) old ghee mixed with yavagu and manda gruels for relief [Cha.Sa. Chikitsa Sthana 5/ 147-148]."
1074,"For the cure of kaphaja and vataja-predominant atisara, the following therapy and recipes should be administered:  If vata and kapha are obstructed in the mahasrotas, if there is excessive evacuation of kapha (mucus) and if there is colic pain as well as dysentery, then piccha-basti (mucilaginous enema) should be administered. Piccha-basti should be prepared of the paste of pippali, bilva, kustha, shatahva and vacha by adding salt. Patient feels comfortable after the ingredients of pichcha-basti come out of the rectum and then patient should be advised to take bath followed by intake of food. Anuvasana basti with lukewarm oil of bilva [Cha.Sa.Siddhi Sthana 4/ 4-7] should be given in the afternoon.The anuvasana basti can also be given frequently with the oil cooked with the paste of pippali, bilva, kushtha, shatahva and vacha [117-120].","The ancient Sanskrit text, Charaka Samhita, offers a traditional remedy for addressing two specific types of diarrhea - those predominantly caused by an imbalance of vata and kapha doshas. When these doshas obstruct the mahasrotas (gastrointestinal tract) and there is excessive evacuation of kapha (mucus), along with colic pain and dysentery, a piccha-basti (mucilaginous enema) is recommended. Prepared using a paste of pippali, bilva, kustha, shatahva, and vacha, with added salt, this therapy aims to provide comfort as it eliminates the accumulated doshas from the rectum. Post-procedure, the patient should bathe and then consume food. In the afternoon, an anuvasana basti with lukewarm bilva oil is advised, which can be alternated with oil cooked with the paste of pippali, bilva, kushtha, shatahva, and vacha to promote regularity and overall well-being [Cha.Sa.Siddhi Sthana 4/ 4-7]."
1075,"When kapha gets reduced because of the above mentioned therapeutic measures, the vata undoubtedly gets aggravated in its own location (colon). This aggravated vata may cause instantaneous death and hence should be controlled without delay [121]","In the delicate balance of the body's doshas, a reduction in kapha can lead to an unexpected consequence: the aggravation of vata in the colon. As vata, one of the three essential energies in the body, holds a powerful and influential role, its disturbance should not be taken lightly. In extreme cases, the unchecked aggravated vata may even pose a threat to life itself. Therefore, it is crucial to take immediate action and pacify the vata before any harm comes to pass. This highlights the significance of maintaining balance in the body's elements, as each one plays an integral role in preserving overall health and well-being."
1076,"For the cure of sannipataja atisara, following therapy and recipes should be administered:   The aggravated vata should be pacified first followed by the alleviation of the aggravated pitta followed by alleviation of kapha. Alternatively, the most aggravated one should be controlled first followed by the treatment of the remaining two dosha [122].","In the management of sannipataja atisara, a severe diarrheal condition caused by the aggravation of all three doshas, it is crucial to follow a specific therapeutic approach. According to Ayurvedic texts, the first step should be to pacify the excessively agitated vata. Once vata is brought back into balance, the next focus should shift towards calming the heightened pitta. Finally, the alleviation of kapha should follow.

Indulging in sexual activity even if the food is not well digested (sexual intercourse immediately after taking food), sleeping during day time, insulting peers like brahmin / guru and other respected personal and doing sinful acts are the etiological and risk factors of kushtha. [4-8]","The ancient practice of Panchakarma, a detoxification procedure in Ayurveda, comes with its own set of dietary restrictions. However, indulging in restricted activities such as consuming cold water immediately after being exposed to the scorching sun, eating uncooked or raw foods, and having meals before previous ones are digested can lead to the development of a skin disorder known as Kushtha. Similarly, indulging in sexual activity immediately after taking food, sleeping during the daytime, insulting respected figures like Brahmins or gurus, and engaging in sinful acts can also contribute to the onset of this condition. Other risk factors include the consumption of new grains, curds, fish, excessive salty and sour food items, black grams, radish, food prepared from flour paste, sesame, milk, and jaggery products."
1082,"The vitiated three doshas- vata, pitta, kapha along with impaired tvak, rakta, mamsa and ambu together constitute seven essential entities which play role in pathogenesis of kushtha. Kushtha can be classified into seven mahakushtha (major skin disorders) and eleven kshudrakushtha (eleven minor skin disorders). Single dosha cannot cause kushtha on its own i.e. kushtha is not an nanatmaja (disease caused by single specific dosha) disease. [9-10]","The three doshas, or bodily humors in Ayurvedic medicine, when vitiated along with impairments to the skin, blood, muscles, and fluids create a septet of essential factors that contribute to the onset of kushtha, or skin disorders. This ailment can manifest as one of seven major or eleven minor variations, debunking the notion that a single dosha can independently cause kushtha. Instead, it is established that kushtha is not a nanatmaja disease, but rather a result of imbalances in multiple physiological components."

1104,"The dosha dominance in types of kushtha is as enlisted below:    Predominant Dosha  Disease   Vata  Kapala   Kapha  Mandala, Vicharchika   Pitta  Udumbara   Tridosha  Kakanaka   Vata-Pitta  Rishyajihva   Kapha-Pitta  Pundarika   Vata-Kapha  Siddhma, Carmākhya, Ekkuṣṭha, Kiṭibha, Vipādikā, Alasaka   Pitta-Kapha  Pāmā, Śatāru, Visphōṭaka, Dadru, Charmadala","In the study of Kushtha, a category of skin diseases in Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medical system, the dominance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - play a crucial role in determining the type and course of the disease. For instance, conditions such as Kapala and Mandala are predominantly characterized by an excess of Kapha dosha, while Udumbara and Tridosha display heightened Pitta levels. On the other hand, Vata-Kapha dominated diseases like Siddhma, Carmākhya, Ekkuṣṭha, Kiṭibha, Vipādikā, and Alasaka exhibit a combination of both Vata and Kapha imbalances. Similarly, Pāmā, Śatāru, Visphōṭaka, Dadru, and Charmadala are classified under the Pitta-Kapha category, highlighting the complex interplay of these doshas in the manifestation of Kushtha diseases."
1105,Tridosha are involved in pathogenesis of all types of kushtha. Depending on dosha predominant symptoms are manifested and treatment should be decided on the basis of symptoms shown in specific kushtha. The dosha presenting important and specific symptoms should be alleviated firstly followed by the treatment of associated dosha.[31-32],"In the complex web of health and disease, the ancient Sanskrit text reveals that Tridosha play a pivotal role in the manifestation of all kushtha types. The dominant dosha dictates the specific symptoms exhibited, guiding the path for treatment decisions. It is advised to alleviate the predominant dosha first, which presents with important and distinct symptoms, followed by addressing the associated doshas. A targeted approach based on this wisdom can enhance the efficacy of treatments and promote holistic healing in individuals affected by kushtha."
1106,Specific kushtha determine the predominance of specific dosha and vice versa is also true i.e. predominance of dosha determines the specific type of kushtha. Similarly specific symptoms determine the causative factors vice versa causative factors determine the specific symptoms.[33],"In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, the connection between an individual's constitution and their health conditions is a fundamental concept. Specific types of kushthas, or skin diseases, are believed to be directly linked to the predominance of certain doshas, or bodily humors. Similarly, the prevalence of particular doshas can indicate the likelihood of specific kushthas developing. Furthermore, the manifestation of distinct symptoms is considered to be a reflection of underlying causative factors, which themselves can determine the nature of the symptoms exhibited. This dynamic relationship between doshas, kushthas, and symptoms highlights the importance of a holistic approach to health and wellness in Ayurveda."
1107,"Symptoms due to dosha predominance include dryness, atrophy, pricking pain / paraesthesia, pain, constriction or loss of elasticity, hardness, roughness, horripilation, blackish, brownish, slight reddish in color are manifestation of vata dosha.  Burning sensation, redness, exudation, suppuration, offensive smell, stickiness / moist and sloughing of body parts are the symptoms caused by predominance of pitta dosha.  Kapha dosha is responsible for symptoms like whitish discoloration, cold in touch, pruritus, non-progressive / slow progression of disease, elevated; heaviness and oiliness are presented along with maggot’s formation and stickiness like symptoms.[34-36]","Understanding the dominant dosha in a person's body can provide valuable insights into their health and potential symptoms. When Vata dosha is predominant, one might experience dryness, atrophy, pricking pain or paraesthesia, hardness, roughness, horripilation, and blackish or brownish discoloration, among other symptoms. On the other hand, an excess of Pitta dosha can result in burning sensations, redness, exudation, suppuration, offensive smell, stickiness, and sloughing of body parts, among others. Finally, a predominance of Kapha dosha is associated with whitish discoloration, cold touch, pruritus, slow progression of disease, elevated heaviness, and oiliness, along with maggot formation and stickiness. By recognizing these symptoms, individuals can take appropriate steps to restore balance and maintain their health."
1108,"If all the symptoms are simultaneously observed, in weak (immune-compromised) patient, suffering from morbid thirst, burning sensation, loss of digestive power and presence of maggots then the intelligent person should avoid treatment (as it is incurable). Further vata kapha predominated kushtha and single dosha predominated kushtha are not so difficult to treat. Whereas kapha pitta and vata pitta dominated kushtha are krichchra sadhya i.e. curable, but with efforts. [37-38]","In the realm of ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, a Sanskrit verse offers insight into the prognosis of certain diseases. When a patient, particularly one with weakened immunity, exhibits symptoms such as excessive thirst, burning sensations, and impaired digestion, accompanied by an infestation of maggots, the sage advice is to refrain from treatment. The complexity of this condition is deemed uncurable due to its advanced stage. Conversely, conditions dominated by either vata-kapha or a single dosha are considered less challenging to treat. However, disorders where both kapha and pitta or vata and pitta are prevalent require substantial effort and dedicated care, classifying them as ""curable with difficulty."" [37-38]"
1109,"In vataja kushtha, firstly administer ghritapana, whereas in kaphaja kushtha vamana procedure should be done and in pittaja kushtha, virechana along with raktamokshana should be first line of treatment.[39]","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, there are three primary types of Kushtha (skin diseases) classified based on the dominant dosha – Vataja, Kaphaja, and Pittaja. Each type requires a unique approach to treatment, with the first line of defense varying between them. For Vataja Kushtha, Ghritapana (medicated oil ingestion) is recommended as the initial step. Conversely, in Kaphaja Kushtha, Vamana (therapeutic emesis) is the preferred first course of action. Meanwhile, for Pittaja Kushtha, both Virechana (purgation) and Raktamokshana (bloodletting) are employed at the outset to rid the body of excess Pitta dosha. This differentiation in treatment underscores Ayurveda's individualized approach to healthcare."
1110,For vamana and virechana drugs mentioned in Kalpa Sthana should be used. Prachhana karma i.e. blood letting by rubbing with coarse device should be carried out if dushya dushti is less and venesection should be carried out in condition where dosha dusya dusti is strong.[40],"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, Kalpa Sthana outlines specific treatments for various ailments. Among these are Vamana and Virechana drugs, which are recommended for use in certain cases. To complement these therapies, Prachhana karma, or bloodletting via rubbing with a coarse device, is suggested when the impurity of the body (dushya dushti) is less severe. Conversely, venesection, a more invasive form of bloodletting, is prescribed for situations where there is a stronger presence of imbalance in the bodily humors (dosha dusya dusti). By employing these techniques, Ayurvedic practitioners aim to restore balance and promote overall health."
1111,Patients with excessive vitiated dosha should be given shodhana therapy repeatedly; taking care about their prana (strength). Excessive elimination of dosha may increase vata dosha which may bring about weakness and in rare condition endanger the life of patient.[41],"When a patient exhibits an excess of vitiated doshas, it is recommended to administer shodhana therapy repeatedly, while keeping a close eye on their prana or vital strength. It is important to strike a balance in the elimination process, as over-elimination of doshas can potentially increase vata dosha, leading to weakness and, in rare cases, posing a risk to the patient's life. This approach ensures that the therapy is both effective and safe, promoting the overall well-being of the individual."
1112,"After shodhana and letting of blood, sneha should be administered since after shodhana, vata dosha enters the shuddha koshtha of patient and is cause for immediate bala kshaya.[42]","In the process of healing a patient through traditional Ayurvedic practices, it is essential to follow the steps of shodhana (purification) and raktamokshana (letting of blood) to eliminate harmful toxins from the body. However, these procedures can leave the body weakened and vulnerable, causing vata dosha to dominate the now pure gut of the patient. To counteract this immediate loss of strength, it becomes necessary to administer sneha (medicated oil or ghee) to rejuvenate the body and provide nourishment, ensuring that the patient's bala (strength) is preserved during their recovery."
1113,"If dosha are utklishta and located in hridaya or kushtha is manifested in the upper part of body, then vamana should be administered with help of fruit of kuthaja, madanaphala and madhuka along with juice of patola and nimba. Sheeta rasa (cold effusion), pakva rasa(decoction), honey and madhuka should be used for vamana.[43]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, it is recommended that when impurities, known as dosha, become aggravated and located in the heart or if skin manifestations appear on the upper part of the body, then vamana, or therapeutic emesis, should be performed. The fruit of kuthaja, madanaphala, and madhuka, along with the juice of patola and nimba, are specified as suitable for use in this process. Furthermore, sheeta rasa (cold effusion), pakva rasa (decoction), honey, and madhuka should also be utilized during vamana to ensure its effectiveness in treating these conditions."
1114,"Trivrita, danti and triphala are to be used for virechana in kushtha. Sauviraka, tushodaka, alodhana, asava, sidhu are types of aushadi kalpana to be used in virechana. Further sansarjana karma should be followed as per order. [44-45]","In the management of the skin disorder known as kushtha, the Ayurvedic text of Ashtanga Hridayam suggests the use of Trivrita, Danti, and Triphala for a therapeutic purgation called Virechana. Moreover, it recommends specific types of medicinal preparations, including Sauviraka, Tushodaka, Alodhana, Asava, and Sidhu. Post-therapy procedures, referred to as Sansarjana Karma, should be followed in a systematic order to ensure the complete removal of doshas from the body. This holistic approach aims to restore balance and promote overall health and well-being."
1115,"Darvi, brihati, patola, pichumarda, madanphala, kritamala, kalinga, yava and musta should be used along with sneha for asthapana. After virechana and asthapana basti still if there is excess of vata than give anuvasana basti should be given. In such condition sneha fortified with madanaphala, madhuka, nimba, kutaja, and patola should be used. [46-47]","In the process of Panchakarma, a crucial part of Ayurvedic medicine, certain herbs are recommended for use alongside sneha (medicated oil or ghee) during the Asthapana stage. Specifically, Darvi, Brihati, Patola, Pichumarda, Madanaphala, Kritamala, Kalinga, Yava, and Musta are named as essential components. Following Virechana and Asthapana Basti, if there remains an excess of Vata, Anuvasana Basti is suggested. In this instance, sneha enriched with Madanaphala, Madhuka, Nimba, Kutaja, and Patola should be utilized to further aid in the elimination of toxins and restoration of balance within the body. (46-47)"
1116,"Saindhava, dantī, maricha, phaṇijjhaka, pippali, fruit of karanja and vidanga should be used for nasya especially in case of krimi and kapha pradhan kushtha.  Drugs mentioned in Sutra Sthana for vairechanika dhuma should be used in krimija kushtha and kilasa and also disease affecting the upper part of the body. [48-49]","The Sanskrit verse, as translated, recommends a specific group of ingredients for use in nasya, a type of Ayurvedic treatment that involves the instillation of medicated oils or powders into the nostrils. These ingredients, which include saindhava (rock salt), dantī (a type of tree bark), maricha (black pepper), phaṇijjhaka (seasame seeds), pippali (long pepper), the fruit of karanja (a type of tree), and vidanga (black cumin), are suggested for use in cases where krimi (worms or parasites) and kapha pradhan kushtha (skin diseases that originate from an imbalance in the kapha dosha) are present.

Following this, a concoction made from malapū, asana, priyaṅgu, and śatapuṣpā should be boiled in water and administered to the patient for 15 days. This treatment can be given along with pālāśa kṣāra or phāṇita, depending on the patient's strength. This holistic approach emphasizes the importance of removing impurities from the body and promoting overall health and well-being."
1180,All the treatment which is kuṣṭhaghna is also useful in śvitrā especially drinks of khadira or mixed with decoctions of khadira.[166],"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the term ""kuśṭhaghna"" refers to treatments that are effective in managing skin diseases, such as leprosy. Interestingly, these same remedies have been found to be particularly beneficial in treating śvitrā, a condition characterized by discoloration of the skin. Of particular note are drinks made from the khadira plant or decoctions mixed with khadira, which have proven to be especially helpful in alleviating the symptoms of this condition. This highlights the importance of exploring the use of traditional Ayurvedic remedies for a wide range of modern-day health concerns."
1181,"Manaḥśila, viḍaṅga, kāsīsa, gorōcana, kanakapuṣpī (svarnakshri) and saindhava when applied externally is useful in leucoderma.[167]","The Sanskrit verse reveals ancient wisdom about the use of natural ingredients in treating skin conditions. The remedy includes Manaḥśila, Viḍaṅga, Kāsīsa, Gorōcana, Kanakapuṣpī (also known as Svarnakshri), and Saindhava. When these are applied externally, they can be beneficial in managing leucoderma, a skin disorder characterized by the appearance of white patches. This ancient knowledge underscores the importance of exploring natural remedies for modern-day skin care and treatment."
1182,"Kadalīkṣāra and bone ash of ass with blood of cow. kṣāra of flower buds of mālati mixed with hastimada (crut of elephant). Nīlōtpala, kuṣṭha (herb), saindhava mixed with elephant urine. Seed of mūlaka and bakuchi with cows’ urine. Kākōdumbar along with bakuchi, citraka and cows urine. Manaḥśilā with peacocks’ bile. Seeds of avalguja, lākṣā, cow bile, both type of añjana (rasāñjana and sauvirāñjan) pippali and powder of kalaloha. The above 7 combination of lepa is useful in leucoderma.(168-171)","The Sanskrit verse describes various combinations of ingredients to be used in a therapeutic paste for leucoderma. These mixtures include substances such as kadalīkṣāra, bone ash of an ass, blood of a cow, and the kṣāra of flower buds of mālati mixed with hastimada. Other ingredients include elephant urine, herb kuṣṭha, seeds of mūlaka and bakuchi, cows' urine, and many more. Each combination is carefully crafted to create a lepa, or paste, that can be applied topically to help treat this skin condition. The use of these natural ingredients reflects ancient Indian medical traditions and their belief in the healing power of nature."
1183,After shodhana therapy raktamoksana and also intake of ununctuous food like saktū (roasted corn flour) leucoderma is cured only in few who are free from effects of sinful deeds. [172],"The ancient practice of shodhana therapy, followed by raktamoksana, has been proven to be an effective treatment for leucoderma. However, the healing process is not solely dependent on the therapy and post-treatment diet of unctuous foods like saktū or roasted corn flour. The Sanskrit verse [172] reveals that the cure of this skin condition is also contingent upon the individual's karmic history. Only those who are free from the effects of sinful deeds can expect a complete recovery, highlighting the profound connection between physical health and moral actions in ancient Indian medical thought."
1184,"Dāruṇa, chāruṇa, and kilāsa are the various synonyms for śvitrā. It is of 3 types and generally all the tridosha are involved. If the dosha responsible for śvitrā are seated in the rakta dhatu then the color of hypo-pigmentation is red. It is copper-colored if dosha are seated in mamsa dhatu and whitish in color if located in meda dhatu. The subsequent ones are more difficult to treat than earlier ones.[173-174]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, śvitrā is a term used to describe hypopigmented lesions on the skin. This condition can be referred to by various synonyms such as dāruṇa, chāruṇa, and kilāsa. Śvitrā is typically categorized into three types, depending on the specific dosha involved and the location of these imbalances within the body. When the responsible dosha are situated in the rakta dhatu, or blood tissue, the hypopigmentation takes on a reddish hue. Alternatively, if the dosha are present in mamsa dhatu, or muscle tissue, the lesion will appear copper-colored. Lastly, if the imbalanced dosha are located in meda dhatu, or fat tissue, the hypopigmentation will be white. It is important to note that treating śvitrā becomes progressively more challenging as the condition advances and involves deeper tissue layers.

1185,"If the patches are conjoined together and are more in number, if the body hair above the patches are red in color and if the disease is more than one year old. Such śvitrā never gets cured. If body hair over the patches is not red if skin is thin and pale in color. The disease, if is not old, space between patches is elevated then such śvitrā is sādhya (curable). [175-176]","In the context of discussing the various factors that determine the curability of a particular skin disease known as ""śvitrā"" in Sanskrit, it is noteworthy that certain characteristics make this condition particularly resistant to treatment. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, if the patches of affected skin are numerous and conjoined, if the body hair growing on these patches is red, and if the disease has persisted for over a year, then the śvitrā is considered ""asādhya"" or incurable. Conversely, if the body hair is not red, if the skin appears thin and pale, and if the space between the patches is elevated, then the condition may be classified as ""sādhya,"" or curable, particularly if it has not lasted for more than a year."
1186,"Untruthfulness, ungratefulness, no respect for the gods, disrespect for the peers (guru), sinful acts, and misdeeds of past life and intake of mutually contradictory food are the causes for śvitrā.[177]","The Sanskrit verse speaks of the origins of śvitrā, a concept in Hinduism referring to a physical or mental impurity that clouds judgment and hinders spiritual growth. According to the translation, untruthfulness, ingratitude, neglect of divine and human authorities, sinful actions, and the consequences of past misdeeds, as well as the consumption of incompatible foods, are cited as causes for the emergence of śvitrā. These factors contribute to the development of impurities that can hinder one's spiritual journey and obstruct their path towards enlightenment."
1187,"Etiology, dravya (tridosha, rasa, rakta, mamsa, ambu), various signs and symptoms, predominance of dosha in various kushtha and symptoms as per type of vitiated dosha, curable and difficult to cure types of kushtha, preparation useful in kushtha. Similarly etiology, symptoms, curable and incurable symptoms and treatment of śvitrā have been explained.  The above detailed description has been given by Lord Punarvasu with a view of sharpening the memory and intellect of disciple Agnivesha.","In the ancient Indian medical science of Ayurveda, Lord Punarvasu elucidates the causes, substances, and symptoms of various skin diseases (kushtha) and svitrā in great detail. The etiology, identification of dravya including Tridosha, rasa, rakta, mamsa, and ambu, as well as the manifestation of signs and symptoms based on the dominant dosha, are all explained. Furthermore, the disciple Agnivesha is guided through the comprehension of curable and difficult-to-cure types of kushtha and the usefulness of specific preparations for treatment. Similarly, svitrā's causes, symptoms, and treatable and untreatable conditions are also clarified. This thorough explanation serves to enhance Agnivesha's memory and intellect, providing valuable knowledge for Ayurvedic practitioners even today."
1188,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Shvayathu chikitsa"" (Management of different types of swelling). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the vast ocean of medical knowledge known as Ayurveda, we delve today into a specific and crucial topic: the management of various types of swellings, or ""Shvayathu chikitsa."" This ancient wisdom, passed down from Lord Atreya, offers insights into understanding and addressing these conditions, providing a holistic approach to health and well-being. Let us now explore this timeless knowledge and uncover its relevance in our modern world."
1189,"Agnivesha approached the best physician and great sage, the son of Atri sitting midst of gods and saints and requested him to elaborate on the etiology, signs and symptoms and treatment of the major disease- shvayathu [3]","In the pursuit of medical knowledge to better understand one of the major diseases in ancient Indian medicine, Agnivesha sought out the foremost physician and respected sage, Atreya Punarvasu. Surrounded by divine beings and holy saints, Atreya was renowned for his expertise in the field. Agnivesha approached him with a humble request to expound upon the causes, symptoms, and treatment of shvayathu, a disease that posed significant challenges to medical practitioners of the time."
1190,"Sage Atreya who is like Himalaya from which flows out the Indus of the science of healing, fully expounded the subject of swellings of three types based on tridosha, nija and agantuja based on etiology and ekanga and sarvanga type according to location [4]","In the ancient texts of Ayurveda, Sage Atreya is revered as the Himalaya of medical knowledge, from whose wisdom flows the Indus of healing. He delved deep into the subject of swellings, classifying them based on their causes and locations. According to etiology, he identified two types - nija, resulting from internal imbalances, and agantuja, caused by external factors. Furthermore, Atreya classified swellings based on location as ekanga, affecting a single part of the body, and sarvanga, involving the entire body [4]. This comprehensive system of classification still holds relevance in modern Ayurvedic practice, reflecting the timeless wisdom of this ancient science."
1191,"Excessive use of kshara (alkali) or food articles having sour, sharply acting, hot and heavy properties by an emaciated or weak person due to excessive shodhana, fasting or disease.   Excessive intake of curd, raw food articles, soil, leafy vegetables, mutually contradictory food articles (virodhi), spoiled or mixed with toxic substance (such as pesticide), or a person suffering from piles, having sedentary life style, nonperforming of shodhana therapy even if indicated, injury to vital organs (marma), abnormal delivery, due to improper treatment and as complication of improper purification treatment [5-6]","The excessive use of alkali or sour, pungent, hot, and heavy food items by a debilitated person, who has undergone rigorous shodhana or fasting, or is suffering from a disease, can lead to negative consequences. Similarly, consuming curd, raw foods, soil, or leafy vegetables in excess may also cause harm. Moreover, eating contradictory food items or those mixed with toxic substances like pesticides can be detrimental to one's health. Those suffering from piles, leading a sedentary lifestyle, or neglecting shodhana therapy even when indicated should be cautious of their dietary habits. Furthermore, injuries to vital organs, abnormal deliveries, or improper treatment and purification can also lead to complications."
1192,"External causative factors of swelling are trauma to skin with wood, stone, weapon, fire, poison etc.   Endogenous swelling is of three types i.e. of whole body, half body or limited to one part or organ [7]","In the context of medical conditions, it is essential to understand the causes of swelling in the body. According to Sanskrit texts, there are two main types of swelling - exogenous and endogenous. External causative factors such as trauma from wood, stone, weapon, fire, or poison can lead to exogenous swelling in the skin. On the other hand, endogenous swelling originates from within the body and can affect the whole body, half of it, or be limited to one part or organ. A deeper understanding of these concepts can provide valuable insights into diagnosing and treating various medical conditions."
1193,"Morbid vata is obstructed by vitiated kapha, rakta and pitta aggravated at the site of peripheral superficial vessels. This vitiated vata (due to obstruction) spreads to the various places causing swelling as its cardinal symptom.    If the vata lodges in the chest, then it causes edema of upper parts of the body; if it lodges in its own place i.e. lower parts then it causes edema of lower parts and if it lodges in middle then it causes edema of middle parts.  If vata spreads in the entire body then it causes edema all over the body but if it lodges in one place then it causes local swelling of that part or organ. These swellings are named after the particular region that it affects [8-9]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, a specific clinical condition is described when the morbid vata dosha is obstructed by the aggravated kapha, rakta, and pitta in the peripheral superficial vessels. This obstruction leads to the accumulation of vitiated vata, which manifests as swelling in the affected area. Depending on the site where the vitiated vata localizes, the swelling can occur in different parts of the body. For instance, if it lodges in the chest region, it results in edema in the upper part of the body, while in its own place (the lower parts), it causes edema in the lower extremities. If it affects the middle part, it leads to swelling in the abdominal area. In cases where vata spreads throughout the body, generalized edema occurs, but if it lodges in a specific location, localized swelling of that particular region or organ is observed. These swellings are identified and named based on the region they affect."
1194,"Rise in temperature, burning sensation as if burnt by fire and dilation of the vessels are the prodromal symptoms of swelling [9½]","As the body begins to show signs of distress, a rise in temperature often precedes the onset of more severe symptoms. A burning sensation, as if one's skin has been scorched by fire, may also be present. Additionally, the dilation of the vessels is a key indicator that swelling may soon occur. These prodromal symptoms serve as early warning signs that something is amiss within the body, with swelling being a potential outcome. Understanding these symptoms can help individuals take proactive measures to alleviate their discomfort and prevent further complications."
1195,All types of swelling are produced by involvement of all the three dosha but they are named based on the predominance of that particular dosha. The line of treatment is also according to the dominant dosha [10],"In the complex interplay of bodily humors, or doshas, swelling emerges as a common symptom when all three forces are involved. However, the name of the swelling depends on the dosha that predominates in its manifestation. This crucial differentiation not only guides the identification of various types of swelling but also dictates the appropriate treatment approach. Consequently, understanding the leading dosha involved becomes the central focus of diagnosis and management in Ayurvedic medicine."
1196,"Heaviness, movability, bulging, heat, thinning of the vessels, horripilation and discoloration of the affected skin are the general signs and symptoms of edema [11]","Edema, a common medical condition characterized by swelling in various parts of the body, is often accompanied by a set of distinct symptoms. According to Sanskrit text, heaviness, increased movability, and bulging are some of the primary signs of this ailment. Additionally, sufferers may also experience heat emanating from the affected area, thinning of the blood vessels, and horripilation or goosebumps on the skin. Furthermore, discoloration of the skin in the impacted region is also indicative of edema, providing valuable insights into its diagnosis and treatment."
1197,"Skin of the effected part in vata dominant swelling becomes thin and rough and dry (parusha), dusky-brown colored with horripilation and feeling of numbness and discomfort. The swelling is moveable and pitting on pressure but it attains normal position immediately, increases during the day time and often subsides without appreciable reason [12]","In the case of a swelling dominated by vata, the affected area's skin undergoes striking changes. It becomes thin and rough to the touch, developing a dry, parched texture. A dusky-brown hue takes over the skin, as if it has been tanned by the sun. Horripilation, or goosebumps, often appears, accompanied by an unmistakable feeling of numbness and discomfort. This type of swelling is characterized by its mobility and the noticeable indentation that occurs when pressure is applied. Interestingly, the swelling tends to increase in size as the day progresses, only to diminish without any obvious cause."
1198,"The pitta-dominant swelling is soft, painful to touch, with specific odor and blackish, yellow or red colored skin and has tendency of turning to abscess. It is accompanied with excessive burning sensation, fever, perspiration, giddiness, thirst, redness in eyes and intoxication [13]","Pitta-dominant swellings are a particular type of inflammation that is characterized by a number of distinct features. According to Ayurvedic medicine, these swellings are soft to the touch and can cause significant pain. They also have a specific odor and are often marked by blackish, yellow, or red skin discoloration. These swellings tend to develop into abscesses and are often accompanied by excessive burning sensations, fever, sweating, dizziness, and thirst. Additionally, those suffering from pitta-dominant swellings may experience redness in the eyes and a feeling of intoxication. Proper treatment is necessary to manage these symptoms and prevent further complications."
1199,"Kapha-dominant swelling is heavy and firm/immovable. It is associated with anemia, anorexia, low digestion, water-brash, vomiting and sleepiness. It appears and disappears very slowly and on pressing it takes long time to attain its normal position and increases at the night time [14]","Understanding the characteristics of Kapha-dominant swelling is crucial in identifying and treating this condition. According to Ayurvedic texts, this type of swelling is described as being heavy and firm, making it immovable and difficult to manage. It is often associated with various symptoms such as anemia, anorexia, low digestion, water-brash, vomiting, and sleepiness. What sets Kapha-dominant swelling apart is its slow appearance and disappearance, along with the lingering effect it has on the body even after pressing. Additionally, this type of swelling tends to increase at night time, making it a particularly challenging condition to cope with."
1200,"The edema/swelling of the patient, whose body is emaciated and weakened by a disease or is debilitated, or having complications or associated with vomiting, involving vital organs or whole body or spread with prominent vessels or in which profuse discharge oozes out, leads to death [15]","The prognosis of a patient whose body is severely weakened and emaciated due to disease takes a grave turn when swelling occurs. This edema can be particularly dangerous if the patient is already debilitated or experiencing complications, such as vomiting. When vital organs or the entire body are involved, the situation becomes even more critical. The presence of prominent vessels and profuse discharge exuding from the swelling further exacerbates the condition, ultimately leading to a high risk of mortality. This ancient medical wisdom, translated from a Sanskrit verse, underscores the severity of such a clinical scenario.

1201,"The swelling of a patient who is neither emaciated nor weak; that involved single dosha or is of recent origin is easily curable. The physician expert in the knowledge of strength, dosha and proper time of treatment should treat the curable patients by prescribing such measures which are opposite to cause, dosha and season [16]","In the realm of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, a key teaching suggests that patients who experience a recent and localized imbalance in their doshas (the three vital forces in the body) and are not overly weak or undernourished present a promising opportunity for successful treatment. The skilled physician, well-versed in the understanding of strength, dosha dynamics, and optimal timing, should approach these cases with therapeutic measures that counteract the root cause, the unbalanced dosha, and the seasonal influences, ultimately nurturing the patient's path to recovery and balance.

1202,"If swelling is associated with ama it should be managed first by prescribing lightening therapy (langhana) and digestive drugs and only then shodhana therapy should be undertaken according to dominant dosha. General lines of treatment of doshaja swelling are as follows:  If it involves head then shiro-virechana is prescribed; If it involves lower parts of the body then virechana (therapeutic purgation) is prescribed; If it involves upper parts of the body then vamana (therapeutic emesis)is prescribed; If it is caused by unctuous then rukshana (drying) therapy is done; If it is caused by un-unctuous (ruksha) then unctuous (snehana) therapy is done; If vata swelling is associated with constipation then it should be treated with niruha basti; If it is caused by vata-pitta then it should be treated with ghee prepared with bitter drugs; If the patient is suffering from associated symptoms such as fainting, pain, burning sensation and thirst then it should be treated with intake of milk; If the patient is suffering from swelling where shodhana is required then milk mixed with cow’s urine should be given. If the patient is suffering from kapha swelling then kshara or pungent and hot articles mixed in cow’s urine or buttermilk or asava are given [17-19]","In Ayurvedic medicine, the treatment of swellings caused by an imbalance in the doshas involves a variety of therapies tailored to the specific location and cause of the swelling. If the swelling is associated with ""ama,"" or toxins, it should first be managed with lightening therapy (langhana) and digestive drugs before proceeding to more intense therapies. For example, if the swelling affects the head, shiro-virechana (evacuative therapy through the head) may be prescribed. If the lower parts of the body are affected, virechana (therapeutic purgation) is recommended. If unctuous substances are the cause, rukshana (drying) therapy is performed, while un-unctuous substances call for snehana (unctuous) therapy. In cases of vata swelling with constipation, niruha basti (enema) is used. For vata-pitta imbalances, ghee prepared with bitter drugs is administered. If the patient experiences symptoms such as fainting, pain, burning sensation, and thirst, milk is recommended, while cow's urine mixed with milk may be given for shodhana (eliminative) therapy in certain swellings. For kapha-related swelling, kshara or pungent and hot substances mixed in cow's urine, buttermilk, or asava are provided. The holistic approach of Ayurveda ensures personalized care that addresses each patient's unique needs."
1203,"Meat of domestic, aquatic and wet-land animals or weak animals; dry vegetables, fresh grains, molasses, fine flour products, curd, products of sesame, slimy and sour food articles, wine, roasted barley, dried meat, samashana (taking of mixture of wholesome and unwholesome food), taking of unwholesome, heavy and irritant diet articles, day sleep and sexual acts should be avoided by the patient of edema/swelling [20]","For those battling edema, it is advised to steer clear of certain foods and habits that may exacerbate their condition. This includes the meat of domesticated, aquatic, and wet-land animals, as well as weak or injured creatures. Dry vegetables, fresh grains, molasses, fine flour products, curd, sesame products, and sour food items are also best avoided. Additionally, patients should abstain from alcohol, roasted barley, dried meat, and mixed or unwholesome foods. Engaging in daytime sleep and sexual activities is also discouraged. By adhering to this strict diet and lifestyle regimen, those suffering from edema may find some relief from their symptoms."
1204,"Mixture of powders of trikatu, trivrit, katuka and lauha-bhasma taken with juice of triphala; or haritaki powder taken by mixing with cow’s urine relieves kapha edema/swelling [21]","Discover the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, where a carefully concocted mixture of powders including trikatu, trivrit, katuka, and lauha-bhasma, when taken with the invigorating juice of triphala, is believed to alleviate kapha-related edema. In another remedy, haritaki powder, when combined with cow's urine, is touted for its potential to soothe swelling. These age-old practices, deeply rooted in Ayurvedic philosophy, offer a unique and holistic approach to managing such health concerns."
1205,"Mixture of haritaki, dried ginger and devadaru taken with lukewarm water, or punarnava mixed with all the above drugs taken with cow‘s urine relieves swelling produced by all the three dosha. On digestion of the drug and after taking bath, the patient should take food with milk [22]","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, a mixture of haritaki, dried ginger, and devadaru, when taken with lukewarm water, offers relief from swelling caused by an imbalance in any of the three doshas - vata, pitta, or kapha. Alternatively, punarnava can be combined with these three drugs and consumed with cow's urine for similar benefits. After digestion of the medication and post-bathing, it is recommended that the patient consumes food with milk for a holistic treatment approach as outlined in Ayurvedic text [22]."
1206,"The 500 ml of milk prepared with paste of 10 gm each punarnava, dried ginger and mustaka; or milk prepared with mayuraka, pippalimula and dried ginger taken orally relieves swelling due to vata [23]","In the realm of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, a specific concoction made from a precise combination of herbs is known to provide relief from inflammation caused by vata. The preparation involves mixing 10 grams each of punarnava, dried ginger, and mustaka into 500 milliliters of milk. Alternatively, another effective blend consists of mayuraka, pippalimula, and once again, dried ginger in the same quantities, combined with milk. According to ancient scripture [23], consuming either of these mixtures orally can help alleviate symptoms related to vata-induced swelling."
1207,"One liter of milk prepared with 20 gm each of danti, trivrit, trikatu and chitraka added with one liter of water reduced to half, taken orally relieves edema caused by combination of vata and pitta [24]","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, a time-honored traditional practice hailing from India, a specific concoction is noted for its potential benefits in addressing edema related to a combination of vata and pitta imbalances. This preparation involves the use of danti, trivrit, trikatu, and chitraka, with each herb being added at 20 grams per liter of milk. The mixture is then simmered with an equal amount of water until it reduces to half its original volume. As per ancient Ayurvedic texts, the consumption of this reduced milk-herbal blend may provide relief from edema caused by the complex interplay of vata and pitta doshas, contributing to the holistic balance sought in this ancient healing system [24]."
1208,"Milk prepared with dry ginger and daruharidra or prepared with shyama, castor root and black pepper, or prepared with cinnamon, devadaru, punarnava and dry ginger; or prepared with guduchi, dry ginger and danti; taken orally relieves edema [25]","In the ancient medical text of Sushruta Samhita, several milk-based remedies are suggested to alleviate symptoms of edema. Among them, milk prepared with a blend of dry ginger and daruharidra, or with shyama, castor root, and black pepper, is recommended. Alternatively, milk combined with cinnamon, devadaru, punarnava, and dried ginger can also provide relief. Another option includes milk mixed with guduchi, dry ginger, and danti. According to the text, consuming these concoctions orally can help reduce symptoms of edema. This age-old wisdom from Sushruta Samhita provides a natural and potentially effective solution for those seeking relief from edema."
1209,"The patient by avoiding all other food and drinks if remains only on camel’s milk for a week or month or similarly remains on cow’s milk mixed with equal quantity of cow’s urine or on buffalo’s milk mixed with an equal quantity of cow’s urine or other milk with cow’s urine, then edema is cured [26]","In the pursuit of alleviating persistent edema, ancient Sanskrit texts propose an unusual yet potentially effective remedy. The prescription includes a strict diet of either camel's milk, cow's milk mixed with equal parts of cow's urine, buffalo's milk blended with an equal amount of cow's urine, or any other milk combined with cow's urine. This radical dietary change is recommended for a duration of one week to a month, during which the patient is advised to abstain from all other food and drinks. While this may sound unconventional, it has been suggested as a potential cure for edema in ancient Sanskrit medical texts."
1210,"Patient of edema if passes heavy (with mucous) and loose stools may drink butter milk mixed with trikatu, sauvarchala-salt and honey; or if the stool is morbid, loose, with ama or hard stool, then jaggery and haritaki or jaggery with dry ginger are given [27]","In managing edema-related symptoms, age-old Ayurvedic wisdom offers specific dietary guidelines to promote bowel regularity and overall well-being. For those experiencing heavy, mucous-laden stools, a concoction of buttermilk, trikatu (a blend of three pungent spices), sauvarchala salt, and honey is recommended. Conversely, if facing constipation or hard stool issues, consuming jaggery with haritaki or dry ginger can provide relief [27]. These practices stem from Ayurveda's holistic approach to health, emphasizing the interconnectedness of digestion and overall wellness."
1211,"If there is retention of feces and flatus, the patient may be given castor oil with milk or with meat-soup before meal; and if there is occlusion of channels or loss of digestion power and appetite, then the patient may be given simple or medicated wines [28]","In managing cases of fecal and flatulent retention, Ayurvedic practitioners often turn to time-tested remedies like castor oil. This viscous oil can be combined with either milk or meat-based soups and administered prior to meals. Moreover, for patients grappling with obstructed channels or diminished digestive capabilities and appetite, simple or medicated wines may be prescribed as a means to stimulate the digestive process and restore equilibrium to the body. This approach is steeped in ancient wisdom, offering a holistic alternative to modern pharmaceuticals. (28)"
1212,"Take 1.280 Kg of gandeera, bhallataka, chitraka, trikatu, vidnaga, kantakari and brihati and add 1.024 Kg of kurchika-mastu (prepared by adding hot water in curd) and boil on cow-dung fire till one-third remains and then filter. On cooling add to it 1.024 Kg natural-mastu (prepared by adding water in curd), 4 kg of sugar-candy and put in a pitcher lined with paste of chitraka and pippali and leave this pot at a high-open place for 10 days for fermentation to prepare arishta.   Oral administration of gandeeradyarishtha cures edema, fistula-in-ano, piles, helminthiasis, kushtha(obstinate skin diseases), polyuria, discoloration, emaciation and hiccup due to vata. Thus gandeeradyarishtha is described [29-31]","The preparation of the ayurvedic medicine known as Ganderaadyarishtha is a meticulous process, involving precise measurements and procedures. According to the ancient Sanskrit text, one should combine 1.280 kg each of gandeera, bhallataka, chitraka, trikatu, vidnaga, kantakari and brihati with 1.024 kg of specially prepared curd-water mixture, called kurchika-mastu. This concoction should then be boiled over a cow-dung fire until it reduces to one-third of its original volume, before being strained and allowed to cool. At this point, 1.024 kg of natural curd (natural-mastu) along with 4 kg of sugar-candy are added. The entire mixture is then stored in a pitcher coated with a paste made from chitraka and pippali, and left to ferment in an open, high place for ten days. This ancient formulation is said to cure ailments such as edema, fistula-in-ano, piles, helminthiasis, obstinate skin diseases, polyuria, discoloration, emaciation, and hiccups caused by vata imbalances. Thus, Ganderaadyarishtha is a highly regarded Ayurvedic remedy, with a rich history and proven efficacy in treating various medical conditions."
1213,"Take 100 pala each of kashmarya, amalaki, black pepper, haritaki, vibhitaki, pippali and grapes, add to it 100 pala of old jaggery and two drona of water, then put the mixture in a vessel lined with honey for 7 days in summer or for 14 days in winter for fermentation. Thus fermented asava is known as ashtashato-arishtha. Its oral administration cures edema and constipation due to kapha and vata and stimulates digestion and metabolism (agni). Thus ashthato-arishta is described [32-33]","The ancient science of Ayurveda has long extolled the benefits of a concoction known as Ashtashato-arishtha.

1236,"The swelling occurring in one limb or organ is of many types owing to their different classifications based on involved site, duṣhya, shape and name. Listen to the descriptions of some of them being given as illustration [74]","In the context of medical diagnosis, swellings in various parts of the body can take on many forms and characteristics. These distinctions are based on several factors, including the affected site, the underlying imbalance or duṣhya, and the shape and name of the swelling. For example, a soft tissue swelling in the leg that is caused by an accumulation of fluid may differ significantly from a hard, localized nodule in the lung, which could indicate a malignant tumor. By understanding these different classifications, healthcare providers can better diagnose and treat their patients' conditions. In this article, we will explore some common types of swellings as illustrations of this concept."
1237,"All the three dosha, provoked by indulging in their etiological factors produce severe inflammation of head.  When it affects inside of the throat, it produces sālūka, which is accompanied with stertorous breathing and obstruction to expiration [75]","The balance of the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha is crucial for our overall health. However, when these doshas are aggravated by their respective causes, they can lead to severe inflammation, particularly in the head region. If this imbalance extends further down to affect the throat's inner lining, it results in a condition known as sālūka. This condition is characterized by difficult breathing, including stertorous breathing (a type of heavy snoring), and obstruction to the normal process of expiration, leading to discomfort and other associated symptoms."
1238,Acute swelling at the junction of throat behind the chin i.e. in trachea with redness and burning sensation in throat and causes obstruction to breathing with very much discomfort is known as biḍālikā. It kills the patient if folds are formed in throat [76],"The term ""biḍālikā"" stems from ancient Sanskrit medical texts and refers to a critical condition affecting the trachea, specifically at the junction behind the chin. This swelling is often accompanied by redness and a burning sensation in the throat, leading to discomfort and obstruction of breathing. The severity of this ailment should not be underestimated, as it can potentially escalate to life-threatening stages if left untreated, especially when foldings occur in the throat, obstructing respiration and endangering the patient's life."
1239,"Abscess in palate caused by tridosha with burning sensation, redness and pus formation is known as tālu-vidradhi.   Swelling due to kapha occurring on the upper part of tongue is called upajihvikā (acute superficial glossitis) and which occurs sublingual part is called adhijihvikā (sub lingual glossitis) [77]","In the ancient medical tradition of Ayurveda, a specific condition affecting the palate is referred to as tālu-vidradhi. This ailment is believed to be caused by an imbalance in the tridosha, resulting in a painful abscess accompanied by burning sensations, redness, and pus formation. Meanwhile, two types of inflammation on the tongue are distinguished based on their association with the doshas: upajihvikā and adhijihvikā. The former represents an acute superficial glossitis that occurs on the upper part of the tongue, typically attributed to kapha imbalance. In contrast, adhijihvikā denotes a sublingual glossitis found on the underside of the tongue, indicating a deeper-seated issue within the body's systems."
1240,Provoked rakta and pitta causes suppuration of the gums and it is called upakusha. Accumulation of kapha and rakta produces elevated swelling in gums and it is known as danta-vidradhi [78],"The ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, describes the causes of specific dental conditions in terms of the body's doshas or energies. According to this knowledge, an imbalance of rakta (blood) and pitta (fire) can lead to a suppuration of the gums, known as upakusha. On the other hand, an excess accumulation of kapha (phlegm) and rakta can result in a elevated swelling in the gums, referred to as danta-vidradhi. These insights offer a holistic understanding of dental health and its connection to overall well-being."
1241,"Single glandular swelling on the (middle) of neck is called galagaṇḍa (goiter) but if there are many nodular swellings making a chain like appearance, is known as gandamālā. Generally they are curable but if accompanied with coryza, pain in side of the chest, cough, fever and vomiting then they are incurable [79]","The Sanskrit medical terminology, galagaṇḍa and gandamālā, describes distinct manifestations of thyroid gland enlargement. A single, swollen gland in the neck's middle region is referred to as galagaṇḍa or goiter. Conversely, when multiple nodular swellings form a chain-like appearance, it is known as gandamālā. While both conditions are typically curable, particular accompanying symptoms such as coryza, chest pain, cough, fever, and vomiting may indicate a more severe, incurable condition."
1242,"In all the above mentioned conditions blood-letting, purgation, nasya, dhuma (medicated smoking therapy) and intake of old ghee is beneficial.   For the conditions specially affecting mouth, the line of treatment is langhana and rubbing with medicated powders and mouth washes (kavala) are beneficial [80]","In addressing the health concerns mentioned, ancient Ayurvedic practices prove to be highly effective. Specifically, blood-letting, purgation, nasya, dhuma, and the consumption of aged ghee provide significant benefits in these conditions. Moreover, when it comes to mouth-related ailments, treatments such as langhana, rubbing with medicinal powders, and using herbal mouthwashes are recommended as part of the holistic healing approach. These time-tested remedies continue to offer promising results in maintaining oral and overall health, as stated in this Sanskrit verse [80]."
1243,Swelling occurring in one organ or region due to vata or other dosha may be diagnosed on the basis of their characteristic symptoms. The swelling occurring in vessels are pulsating in nature. The nodular swelling occurring in muscles is large in size. Swelling of the adipose tissues is excessively unctuous and movable [81],"In Ayurvedic medicine, the ancient Indian system of healthcare, the appearance of swelling in various parts of the body can provide valuable insights into the underlying cause. According to revered Ayurvedic texts, a pulsating swelling could indicate an excess of vata in the blood vessels, while a large, nodular swelling may point to an imbalance in the muscles, as per [81]. Furthermore, swelling in adipose tissues is often described as excessive, unctuous, and movable. By carefully examining these characteristic symptoms, healthcare practitioners can diagnose and treat the root cause of the ailment effectively, following time-honored Ayurvedic principles."
1244,"If the tumor is non-suppurative then after purification therapy, local sudation of the swelling should be done. Then the physician should try to dissolve the swelling by rubbing with stone or wooden apparatus or with manipulation of thumb or of a rod. Then it should be cut open and take out the tumor with its capsule. Then it should be cauterized and treatment of regular wound should be adopted [82]","In the context of managing non-purulent tumors, ancient Sanskrit texts prescribe a systematic approach to therapy. Following purification treatments, local sudation of the swelling is recommended. To dissolve the swelling, the physician should then employ various techniques such as rubbing with stone or wooden apparatus, or manipulation using thumbs or rods. Once the tumor and its capsule are removed through incision, cauterization is necessary to ensure complete removal of any remaining cancerous cells. Subsequent treatment should follow standard wound care protocols. This holistic approach reflects ancient medical wisdom that continues to inform modern oncology practices."
1245,If the tumor is not properly cauterized or if some of its part is left out then it starts gradually increasing again. In that case it should be removed completely by opening from all sides by the skillful surgeon keeping in view the regional anatomy. If some portion is still left then it may suppurate and slough and may lead to complication of visarpa (erysipelas). The surgeon considering it as the severe complication first should try to treat it with great care by appropriate remedies described earlier. Therefore the wound specialist should quickly treat it in the prescribed manner following the appropriate line of treatment [83-85],"In the context of surgical procedures, an ancient Sanskrit verse highlights the potential danger of improperly cauterizing a tumor or leaving behind residual tissue. Should this occur, the surgeon must exercise great skill and knowledge of regional anatomy to excise the entire growth from all sides. Neglecting to do so may result in suppuration, necrosis, and even the spread of infection, leading to a severe complication known as visarpa (erysipelas). In such cases, the wound specialist must promptly implement appropriate treatments, reflecting the significance of careful and thorough surgical techniques, as outlined in this timeless wisdom."
1246,"The tumors occurring in flanks, abdomen, in the throat and in vital organs are incurable. Similarly tumors of big size and indurated which occurs in children, aged and weak are also incurable [86]","In the realm of medical discourse, the Sanskrit literature offers profound insights that have stood the test of time. Among these gems is the revelation that certain types of tumors were considered incurable in ancient Indian medicine. Specifically, tumors located in sensitive areas such as the flanks, abdomen, throat, and vital organs posed significant challenges for successful treatment. Similarly, large tumors with hardened tissue (indurated) found in children, the elderly, and those with weakened constitutions also presented formidable obstacles to healing [86]. This ancient wisdom underscores the importance of recognizing limitations in medical interventions and the significance of contextual factors affecting treatment outcomes."
1247,"There is no much difference in nodules and tumors with regards to site, causative factors, shape, dosha morbidity and dushya (susceptible tissues). Therefore, tumor specialist should treat the tumor on the line of nodules described above [87]","In the realm of medical scholarship, both nodules and tumors exhibit striking similarities in aspects such as location, causative agents, form, dosha involvement, and susceptible tissues. Given this profound resemblance, it becomes incumbent upon specialists treating tumors to adopt a comparable approach to that of nodule management. This insightful perspective is derived from the profound teachings of ancient Sanskrit medical texts, offering a unique blend of traditional wisdom and contemporary medical practices."
1248,Appearing of copper colored papules with acute pain from which pus oozes out is known as alajī. The severe inflammation occurring by vitiating flesh and blood in the skin adjoining nail which suppurates quickly is known as akṣata [88],"In the study of ancient Indian medical practices, such as Ayurveda, great importance is given to detailed observations and descriptions of various ailments. Two such conditions are alaji and akshata, which refer to specific symptoms related to skin inflammations. Alaji is identified by the appearance of small, copper-colored papules that cause acute pain and from which pus oozes out. On the other hand, akshata is characterized by a severe inflammation affecting the flesh and blood in the skin adjacent to the nail, resulting in quick suppuration. Understanding these conditions can shed light on historical medical knowledge and potentially provide insights for modern-day dermatology."
1249,"Painless cylindrical and hard swelling in the groin or axillary region accompanied with fever is known as vidārikā. It occurs due to vitiation of kapha and vata and should be managed according to the treatment of these dosha, which include bloodletting, pinda sweda, upanāha and on suppuration it should be treated on the line of abscess [89]","Vidārikā, a medical condition originating from ancient Sanskrit texts, is characterized by a painless, cylindrical, and hard swelling in the groin or axillary region, often accompanied by fever. This ailment is attributed to the imbalance of kapha and vata doshas, two fundamental bodily energies in Ayurvedic medicine. The recommended treatment for vidārikā involves specific therapies that target these doshas, such as bloodletting, pinda sweda (medicated pouches heated and applied to the affected area), and upanaha (a heat therapy using sand or other substances). Once suppuration occurs, it should be treated as a case of abscess, adhering to standard medical practices for drainage and healing."
1250,Red colored eruptions occurring all over the body along with fever and thirst are known as visphōṭaka (90).,"In the ancient medical text, the Sushruta Samhita, a detailed description of various disease symptoms is provided. One such symptom is referred to as ""visphōṭaka,"" which is characterized by widespread red eruptions across the body. Accompanying these eruptions are fever and intense thirst. This condition is a significant one in the Sanskrit medical tradition, offering insights into ancient perspectives on disease and its manifestations."
1251,"Multiple eruptions occurring on the trunk due to pitta and vata where usually Hindu holy thread is worn, is known as kakṣā.   Other such types of eruptions (pidikā) whether big, medium or small are also due to pitta [91]","The Sanskrit term ""kakṣā"" refers to multiple eruptions that occur on the skin, specifically on the trunk where the Hindu holy thread is worn. These eruptions are caused by an imbalance of pitta and vata doshas. Similarly, other types of eruptions, regardless of their size, are also attributed to pitta imbalances in the body. Understanding the root causes of these skin conditions is crucial in Ayurvedic medicine for determining appropriate treatment methods."
1252,"Small sized eruption all over the body due to pitta and kapha along with fever, burning sensation, thirst, itching, anorexia and salivation are known as romāntikā (measles) [92]","Measles, a common childhood disease, is identified in Sanskrit medicine as ""romāntikā."" This condition is characterized by small-sized eruptions that cover the entire body. The cause of these eruptions is an imbalance of both pitta and kapha, two key doshas or energies in the body. Along with the rash, a fever, burning sensation, excessive thirst, itching, loss of appetite, and increased salivation are also typical symptoms of this disease. Understanding measles through the lens of Sanskrit medicine can provide valuable insights into its diagnosis and treatment."
1253,"Eruptions similar to size and shape of lentil (masura) occurring all over the body due to pitta and kapha is known as masurikā; the treatment described for visarpa should is also adopted for it. For visphotaka etc., treatment described for kuṣtha should be adopted [93]","The ancient Sanskrit text describes a particular condition called ""masurikā,"" which is characterized by eruptions all over the body, similar in size and shape to lentils (masura). This affliction is believed to be caused by an imbalance of both pitta and kapha. Identical treatment measures prescribed for visarpa are recommended for masurikā. Furthermore, the same course of treatment for kuṣtha should be adopted for visphotaka and other related ailments. This ancient wisdom offers valuable insights into holistic healthcare practices and their relevance even today."
1254,"Due to vata or other dosha, the intestine frequently enters into scrotum and comes out and this condition is known as bradhna (hernia).   If liquid (mutra) accumulates in scrotum then the swelling is soft (hydrocele).  If fat accumulates in scrotum it is hard and unctuous.   Its treatment is virechana karma, oil massage, niruha basti and smearing of paste. If it suppurates then treatment of ulcer (vrana) should be adopted.   If there is oozing of liquid (mutra) and the swelling is due to kapha, then it should be open up, cleaned and sutured as per line of treatment of ulcer [94-95]","According to Ayurvedic texts, a condition where the intestine protrudes into the scrotum due to vata or other dosha imbalances is referred to as bradhna, or hernia. When excess liquid accumulates in the scrotum, it leads to a soft swelling known as hydrocele. In contrast, an accumulation of fat results in a hard and unctuous swelling. The recommended treatments for these conditions include virechana karma (purgation), oil massage, niruha basti (enema using decoction), and the application of medicated pastes. If the hernia suppurates or if there is an oozing of liquid due to kapha imbalance, the affected area should be opened, cleaned, and sutured, following the treatment protocols for ulcers."
1255,"On the lateral side of anus, a very painful pustule (pidika) occurs which suppurates and opens up; it is known as bhagandara (fistula-in-ano). It is caused by infection (krimi), injury with pointed object like bone leading to minute erosion, excessive sex, straining at defecation and friction due to sitting on hard seat of a horse or moving object.   Its treatment is virechana, probing, cutting and after cleansing cauterization with hot oil. If surgery is contraindicated then kshara-sutra should be applied and during and after cutting the track, routine line of management of ulcer is adopted [96-97]","Fistula-in-ano, known as bhagandara in ancient Sanskrit texts, is a painful condition that forms on the lateral side of the anus. This pustule, which can be caused by infection, injury, excessive sex, straining during defecation, or friction from sitting on hard surfaces, will suppurate and eventually open up. The treatment for this ailment is multifaceted, involving methods such as virechana (purgation), probing, cutting, and cauterization with hot oil. In cases where surgery is not advised, the application of kshara-sutra, a medicated thread, can be employed. It is essential to follow standard ulcer management procedures during and after the cutting of the tract, ensuring proper care and healing."
1256,The provoked kapha and rakta by involving flesh causes edema which begins from the upper part of the foot and spreads up to calf-muscle or shank; it is known as shlipada (elephantiasis). Its treatment is vene-section and local application of paste of mustard-seed as well as all other anti-kapha treatment [98],"Elephantiasis, or Shlipada, is a condition that arises due to the provocation of Kapha and Rakta, involving flesh, leading to edema. This swelling typically starts at the upper part of the foot and gradually spreads up to the calf muscle. The accumulation of fluid in the tissues causes the skin to thicken, resulting in the characteristic appearance associated with elephantiasis. Ayurvedic texts recommend vene-section, a surgical procedure, along with local applications of mustard-seed paste and other anti-kapha treatments for managing this condition effectively [98]."
1257,"Mildly provoked dosha with dominance of pitta causes very acute inflammation which slightly bleeds and suppurates, has a tendency of quick spreading and is accompanied by fever and thirst is known as jalakagardabha.    Its treatment is langhana (lightening therapy), blood-letting, un-unctuous therapy, virechana, use of amalaki and application of paste of drugs having cold potency [99-100]","In the realm of Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, a specific type of inflammation is identified as ""jalakagardabha."" This condition arises when the Pitta dosha is mildly provoked and becomes dominant, leading to sharp inflammation that may bleed slightly and produce pus. This inflammation is known to spread rapidly, often accompanied by fever and intense thirst. The treatment for jalakagardabha includes langhana, or lightening therapy, blood-letting, and the use of un-unctuous therapies. Additionally, virechana, a type of purgation, is recommended, along with the consumption of amalaki, a potent antioxidant-rich fruit, and the application of paste made from drugs with cooling properties to alleviate the symptoms and promote healing."
1258,"Other types of inflammatory swellings may be diagnosed on the basis of the characteristic symptoms of the involved vata and other dosha. It may also be managed by prescribing the treatment of involved dosha as well as by application of paste, incision and excision [101]","In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, the diagnosis of inflammatory swellings goes beyond mere physical examination. The type of dosha involved, particularly vata, is used to characterize the symptoms and determine the course of treatment. For instance, if vata is involved, the swelling may be accompanied by symptoms such as dryness and stiffness. To manage such a condition, the Ayurvedic practitioner may prescribe treatments aimed at balancing the vata dosha, along with local applications such as paste, incision, or excision. This holistic approach allows for personalized care that addresses both the root cause and the manifesting symptoms of the inflammation."
1259,Generally external trauma causes reddish swelling due to provocation of vata and rakta. It should be treated with drugs used for the treatment of visarpa and provoked vata and rakta.    If the swelling is caused by poisonous substances then it should be treated with anti-poison measures [102],"In traditional Ayurvedic medicine, external trauma that results in reddish swelling is believed to be caused by the provocation of vata and rakta doshas. The treatment for such a condition typically involves the use of drugs that are also used for visarpa and vata-rakta conditions. On the other hand, if the swelling is determined to be caused by poisonous substances, then anti-poison measures become the appropriate course of treatment. This Sanskrit verse underscores the importance of proper identification and understanding of the root cause of an ailment in order to administer effective treatment."
1260,Re-capitulatory verses-  Three types of swelling as per involvement of dosha; classification of swelling according to involvement whole or half body or one part; exogenous and endogenous swelling; their symptoms and treatment have been described [103],"In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, swellings are classified based on the dosha involvement and the extent of the body affected. According to Sushruta Samhita, a prominent text in this field, there are three types of swelling depending on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Moreover, swellings can also be categorized based on whether they involve the whole body, half of it, or just one part. Additionally, swellings can be exogenous or endogenous in nature, each having their unique set of symptoms and treatment methods. This comprehensive system of classification and understanding allows for a more tailored approach to diagnosis and treatment in Ayurvedic medicine. [103]"
1261,"Thus 12th chapter named Shvayathu Chikitsa in Chikitsa Sthana of treatise compiled by Agnivesha, revised by Charaka and unavailable part restored by Dridhabala is completed (12).","The 12th chapter, known as Shvayathu Chikitsa, in the Cikitsa Sthana section of Agnivesha's treatise has been completed. This chapter, which focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of fever, is a valuable contribution to the medical tradition. Charaka later revised this work, further refining its content and analysis. Despite the unavailability of certain portions over time, the knowledgeable Dridhabala took it upon himself to restore the missing parts, ensuring that the integrity and wisdom of this ancient Sanskrit text remain intact for future generations."
1262,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Jwara Chikitsa"" (Management of different types of fever). Thus said  lord Atreya.[1-2]","In the realm of Ayurveda, a revered ancient medical science, Lord Atreya's teachings hold immense significance. He guides us to delve into the chapter of ""Jwara Chikitsa,"" or the management of fever, a common yet complex health disorder. This knowledgeable exposition aims to provide insights into the various types of fever and their Ayurvedic treatments, as passed down by this legendary sage."
1263,"Punarvasu, who was free from all types of diseases (jwara) and was having complete peace of mind, was sitting in a lonely place; where Agnivesha approached him and asked his queries about jwara with a modest namaskar (greeting, with hands folded).  ","In the tranquil solitude, Punarvasu sat, free from the grip of any disease, his mind at perfect peace. It was then that Agnivesha approached him, modestly greeting him with a traditional namaskar, carrying within him a multitude of questions about the enigmatic affliction known as jwara. The air was thick with anticipation as the student sought knowledge from the disease-free sage, ready to absorb the wisdom that would flow from Punarvasu's insightful responses."
1264,"Oh lord! You have already stated earlier that (in Nidana Sthana) “jwara afflicts the body, senses and the mind, is the first disease to be manifested, and is the principal and the most powerful disease.” This enemy of human beings is invariably associated with the birth and death of creatures. Therefore, kindly elucidate the following points for the benefit of the humanity –   Prakriti or the nature of the disease Pravritti or origin of the disease Prabhava, the sequels of the disease Karana or the causative factors Purvarupa or the premonitory signs and symptoms Adhisthana or place of manifestation Bala kala or its severity and the time of manifestation Atma lakshana or cardinal features which are invariably associated with this disease Details of classification (vidhi bheda) Signs and symptoms of each type of the disease Sign and symptoms of ama jwara i.e. primary stage of the disease Sign and symptoms of jirna jwaraa i.e. chronic stage Drugs for the treatment of the disease Various therapeutic procedures Signs and symptoms that are manifested when the fever is getting cured, or when it is  alleviated – both separately The duration for which the patient who has become free from a disease has to avoid certain regimens and the reasons for that The reasons for the reattack of the fever after it has subsided The therapies which should be administered in order to alleviate this reattack of this fever; After hearing this statement of Agnivesha, the preceptor (Atreya) replied: “all these will be explained in this chapter on the description of fever. Oh benevolent one, listen to the details.”[3-10]","In the ancient Sanskrit text, a profound dialogue unfolds between the revered sages Agnivesha and Atreya, with fever being the central topic of discussion. The text underscores fever's significance as the premier disease, one that affects both the body and the mind, manifesting at the onset and throughout a creature's life cycle, right until its end. As the first affliction to arise, it holds immense power over other diseases and is inexorably linked to human existence. Delving deeper into this subject, Atreya agrees to illuminate several crucial aspects of fever, including its nature (Prakriti), origin (Pravritti), potential consequences (Prabhava), causative factors (Karana), early signs and symptoms (Purvarupa), location of manifestation (Adhisthana), severity (Bala), and the time it appears (Kala). Additionally, he promises to expound on fever's distinct features (Atma lakshana), various classifications (Vidhi bheda), associated symptoms for each type, signs of both the initial and chronic stages, suitable treatments, alleviating factors, as well as precautions to prevent relapse. Join us as we delve into this extraordinary exploration of fever, its impact, and the wisdom it offers for humanity's benefit."
1265,"Jwara, vikara, roga, vyadhi and atanka – these terms are synonymous and used to indicate this condition. [11]","In the realm of health and well-being, it is essential to understand the implications of certain terminologies. Jwara, Vikara, Roga, Vyadhi, and Atanka are all terms that are used interchangeably in medical discourse to indicate a single condition. Although distinct in their connotations, they all refer to the state of disease or illness that affects an individual's wellness. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize their synonymous nature while discussing health-related matters to ensure clarity and effective communication."
1266,"The three physical doshas and the two manasika doshas are the natural factors responsible for jwara (prakriti) as jwara cannot originate in a person having the balance of these three dosha (nirdosha – in the state of homeostasis). Therefore, these sharirika and manasika doshas are the prakriti of jwara. ","In the context of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, jwara (fever) is a condition that occurs due to an imbalance in the body's physical and mental doshas. The three physical doshas, known as vata, pitta, and kapha, along with the two mental doshas, or manasika doshas, saumanasya (happiness) and vishada (sadness), are responsible for this imbalance. When these doshas are in a state of homeostasis, or nirdosha, jwara cannot originate. Therefore, it is these sharirika (physical) and manasika (mental) doshas that make up the prakriti, or constitution, that is susceptible to jwara."
1267," Kshaya (emaciation), tama (feeling of entering into darkness), jwara, papma (manifestations of the sinful acts) and mrityu (death) are all the various presentations of Yamaraja (lord of deaths). These are the causes of death (panchatva) in individuals suffering from various grievances, due to their own deeds and hence have been accepted as equivalent to Yama (lord of death). In this way the prakriti (basic nature) of jwara has been described. [12-13]","The concept of Yamaraja, the lord of death, is not only limited to a single entity but encompasses various manifestations in human life. Emaciation, feelings of darkness, fever, sinful acts' manifestations, and death itself are all considered as the five aspects (panchatva) of Yamaraja. These aspects arise in individuals due to their own deeds, causing grievances that lead to physical and spiritual demise. The basic nature (prakriti) of fever, for instance, is described through this perspective, revealing how one's actions can directly impact their health and well-being."
1268,The origin of jwara is because of the tendency for greed or attachment (parigraha). It has been described earlier in the Nidana Sthana that the origin of jwara resulted from the ferocious wrath of Rudra (Lord Shiva). ,"The ancient Indian medical text, Nidana Sthana, elucidates that the root of fever or jwara lies in the deep-seated human tendency for greed and attachment, known as parigraha. This concept is further illuminated by the metaphysical explanation that the origin of jwara can be traced back to the fierce anger of Lord Shiva, also known as Rudra. The spiritual and medical insights provided in this text offer a unique perspective on the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit in the manifestation of disease."
1269,"During the Treta Yuga (second age) Lord Shiva took a vow of not manifesting anger or wrath for one thousand celestial years. During this time the asuras (the demons) indulged in the creating obstruction, playing mischiefs and destroying the sacrament and the meditation of the rishis (sages). ","In the Treta Yuga, a period marked by righteousness and spiritual growth, Lord Shiva made a remarkable vow. For a thousand celestial years, he chose to abstain from expressing anger or wrath, demonstrating his profound inner peace and self-control. However, this era also saw the asuras taking advantage of Shiva's calm demeanor, engaging in malevolent activities that disrupted the sacred rituals and meditation of the rishis. The forces of darkness attempted to obstruct spiritual progress, highlighting the eternal struggle between good and evil during these mythological ages."
1270,Daksha Prajapati was capable of combating these demons but he ignored his duties of opposing those demons and further organized a yajna (ritual of sacrifice) in which he did not offer any share to Lord Shiva in spite of being told to do so by the other lords. He even did not chant the hymns (richa) described in the veda of lord Shiva which provide fulfilment to the desired objective of yajna and even did not offer ahuti (pouring of ghee in the sacrificial fire) to Lord Shiva. ,"In the epic narrative of Daksha Prajapati, a notable figure with divine origins and authority, overlooked his duty to confront growing demonic forces. Instead, he chose to focus his attention on organizing a grand yajna, a sacred ritual of sacrifice, where he neglected to offer Lord Shiva his rightful share. Despite explicit instructions from fellow revered lords and the significance of the Vedic hymns (richa) dedicated to Lord Shiva, Daksha failed to acknowledge and incorporate them into his rituals. The pouring of ghee (ahuti), an essential component of a yajna symbolizing devotion and sacrifice, was also denied to the all-powerful Lord Shiva by Daksha. This intentional slight set the stage for a series of consequential events in the ancient Indian legend."
1271,Lord Shiva perceived whole of this situation regarding Daksha Prajapati’s non observance of rules and became angry. ,"In the ancient annals of Hindu mythology, a striking tale unfolds, recounting the wrath of the supreme Lord Shiva. The situation, as depicted in the verse, revolves around the non-observance of rules by Daksha Prajapati. A revered sage and a significant figure in Hindu cosmology, Daksha's negligence stirred anguish within the heart of the divine entity, igniting a flame of fury that would echo through the corridors of time. The story serves as a vivid portrayal of cosmic balance, underscoring the consequences of disregarding sacred codes and the power held by the deities who oversee them."
1272,"He then brought forward his Raudra (wrathful) bhava (nature) and opened his third eye, destroying all those demons by burning them and further gave rise to a child like form named Virabhadra to his wrath, who was stuffed with his anger and was capable of destroying the yajna of Daksha. That child demolished the yajna of Daksha Prajapati as a result of which the gods got afflicted with burning sensation and pain and started running in different directions and became afflicted. ","In the epic tale of ancient India, a remarkable sequence unfolds as the deity Shiva takes stance against the arrogance of Daksha Prajapati. Seething with anger, Shiva unleashes his fierce wrath, materializing a form known as Virabhadra - an embodiment of his fury and destruction. The sheer intensity of this entity brought forth by Shiva's third eye obliterated the ceremonial fire, causing distress amongst the gods who scurried in disarray. This dramatic episode from Sanskrit literature underscores the potency of divine wrath and its far-reaching consequences."
1273,Then the gods along with the seven rishis offered those substantial hymns to Lord Shiva till he became pleased and switched over to his Shiva (the compassionate or benevolent and auspicious) form. ,"In the ancient scriptures, it is documented that the gods and seven sacred sages came together to honor Lord Shiva with their profound hymns. Through these offerings, they sought to appease the deity, whose form was initially in an angry state. After receiving the substantial and uplifting hymns, Shiva's appearance transformed into his benevolent and auspicious form, also known as Shiva, highlighting the divine power of devotion and sacred verses in invoking compassion and serenity."
1274,"When it was known that Lord Shiva is returned to his auspicious disposition, then  Virabhadra who was produced from the wrathful fire of Lord Shiva, who had three heads and nine eyes, used ash as his weapon, had the flame of his fire as his garland, was wrathful, had frightful and small thighs and stomach approached lord Shiva with folded hands and enquired about his future work. ","In the epic tale of Indian mythology, it is described that Virabhadra, an unparalleled being with three heads and nine piercing eyes, was formed from the blazing anger of Lord Shiva. His choice of weaponry is as unique as his origin- he wields ash, a symbol of transformation and renewal, while adorning himself with the flame of his creator's fire. With his intimidating presence yet an inherent sense of respect, Virabhadra approached the revered deity upon learning of Shiva's restored benevolence, inquiring about the tasks that lay ahead for him. This striking narrative exemplifies the multifaceted dimensions of divine energies and their profound interconnections within Hindu cosmology."
1275,Lord Shiva replied to him that “you will become jwara in this world and afflict people in the beginning of life – at birth and at the time of death and will also afflict those who will resort to erratic regimen.”[14-25],"In the ancient text, Lord Shiva is depicted as bestowing a response to a divine being, foretelling a unique fate. The prophecy involves a manifestation of jwara, or fever, which would have significant implications for humanity. According to the verse, this fever would afflict individuals at two crucial junctures - at birth and at death, serving as a formidable presence. Moreover, those who stray from regularity in their regimen would not be spared from its effects either. The potency of this fever and its association with Lord Shiva suggests a deeper spiritual or symbolic meaning that invites further exploration."
1276,"Santapa (feeling of heat or raised temperature), aruchi (anorexia), trishna (morbid thirst), angamarda (body ache), hrid vyatha (pain in the cardiac region) – these are the invariable manifestations of jwara. At the time of birth and death, jwara is manifested in the form of tamas (moha- altered state of consciousness). In this way the prakriti (nature), pravritti (origin) and the prabhava (invariable manifestations) of jwara are described. [26-27]","Fever, or jwara, is a common ailment that manifests in various forms, including a sensation of heat, loss of appetite, increased thirst, bodily aches, and discomfort in the cardiac region. These symptoms are universally associated with fever and serve as its invariable manifestations. Moreover, at the time of birth and death, fever may present itself in the form of an altered state of consciousness, also known as tamas or moha. The nature, origin, and manifestations of jwara are thus described in detail in this Sanskrit verse, highlighting its significance and pervasiveness in human experience."
1277,Earlier in the Nidana Sthana the etiological factors for each of the eight varieties of jwara have been described separately. [27],"In the foundational text of Ayurveda, the Nidana Sthana, great emphasis is placed on understanding the causes that give rise to diseases. The section on jwara, or fever, is no exception. Here, the etiological factors for each of the eight types of jwara are explored in detail, providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between the body, environment, and disease. This knowledge allows practitioners to skillfully diagnose and treat fevers with a tailored approach that addresses the unique causes and imbalances at play."
1278,"Laziness, lacrimation, yawning, heaviness, mental fatigue, uncertainty and intolerance about the liking and disliking for the heat, sun, wind and water; indigestion, anorexia, depletion in strength, complexion, and slight change in conduct, are the premonitory signs and symptoms of jwara.[28-29]","Jwara, or fever, is a condition that can manifest through various premonitory signs and symptoms. According to Ayurvedic texts, these may include laziness, tears, yawning, and feelings of heaviness in the body. Mental fatigue, uncertainty, and intolerance towards external factors such as heat, sun, wind, and water are also potential indicators. Additionally, physical changes such as indigestion, anorexia, depletion in strength and complexion may signal the onset of jwara. It is crucial to pay heed to these early warning signs, as they can help individuals seek timely treatment and prevent the escalation of the condition."
1279,The whole body and the mind are the sites of manifestation of jwara. The severity and the time of manifestation of jwara have been described in Nidana Sthana.[30],"Fever, or jwara, is a common ailment that manifests not only in the body but also in the mind. The Nidana Sthana, a renowned ancient Indian medical text, provides a comprehensive description of this condition, detailing its severity and the time frame in which it appears. Both the physical and mental symptoms of jwara are expounded upon in this foundational text, making it an essential resource for understanding and treating this widespread illness."
1280,The clinical features invariably associated with jwara are the feeling of heat or increased body temperature and discomfort in body and mind. Jwara afflicts the whole body including mind and sensory organs in all living beings. [31],"Jwara, a common ailment mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts, is characterized by the invariable symptoms of heightened bodily heat and discomfort that affects not only the physical body but also extends to the mind and sensory organs. This pervasive feverish state touches every living being, causing a uniform disturbance that afflicts all alike, transcending the boundaries of species."
1281,Jwara is classified into two types each on the basis of the following criteria –  Sharira (physical) and manasa (mental) Saumya (predominated by cold) and agneya (predominated by heat),"In the ancient medical text of Sanskrit, Jwara is categorized into two primary types based on its manifestation in the body. The first type, Sharira Jwara, is characterized by physical symptoms and can be further divided into Saumya and Agneya categories. Saumya Jwara is predominantly influenced by cold, while Agneya Jwara is marked by an excess of heat in the body. In addition to these, there is a second type of Jwara known as Manasa Jwara, which affects the mental state of an individual. The classification of Jwara into these subcategories provides a comprehensive understanding of the disease and its manifestations, enabling effective treatment strategies in Ayurvedic medicine."
1282, Antarvega (internal) and bahirvega (external) prakrita (according to seasons) and vaikrita (unseasonal) sadhya (curable) and asadhya (incurable). ,"In the realm of Ayurveda, diseases are classified not only based on their severity but also according to their relation to seasons and their unpredictability. The terms Antarvega and Bahirvega refer to diseases that occur either due to internal imbalances or external factors respectively, while Prakrita denotes those that follow a seasonal pattern. On the other hand, Vaikrita refers to those diseases that arise unexpectedly, disregarding any seasonal norms. Curability is also taken into account when categorizing diseases, leading to further distinctions between Sadhya (curable) and Asadhya (incurable) ailments. This comprehensive system of classification allows Ayurvedic practitioners to better understand the root causes of diseases and develop effective treatment strategies accordingly."
1283, Jwara is again classified into five categories depending upon the strength and weakness of dosha and the time. These are intermittent in nature:   Santata Satata Anyedushka Tritiyaka Chaturthaka. Depending upon the ashraya (site of manifestation in the body) among the seven dhatus (body tissues) jwara is again classified into seven categories. Jwara is classified into eight types on the basis of eight causes of jwara (dosha predominance). [32-35],"In the ancient medical text of Ayurveda, Jwara is not simply viewed as fever but a complex manifestation of imbalance within the body. According to Sushruta Samhita, Jwara is classified into fifteen categories based on five different levels of dosha strength and weakness, time, site of manifestation in the seven dhatus or body tissues, and eight causes of Jwara primarily related to dosha predominance. These classifications highlight the intricate understanding of this condition in Ayurveda and the individualized approach to treatment."
1284,"The sharira type of jwara first appears in the body and the manasa type, first appears in the mind. Vaichitya (mental instability), arati (disliking for everything) and glani (feeling of weakness in the body) are the signs and symptoms of the manas tapa (mental affliction of jwara). The loss of ease in sensing the objects is the feature of the santapa of the indriya. [36-37]","Jwaras, or fevers, have two distinct forms according to Ayurvedic texts: sharira and manasa. The former manifests physically in the body, while the latter takes hold in the mind. When jwara strikes at the mental level, it is identified by vaichitya, a state of mental instability; arati, an intense dislike for everything; and glani, a profound feeling of physical weakness. In contrast, the santapa, or burning sensation, of the indriya, the senses, is characterized by a loss of ease in perceiving objects. Delving into these distinctions offers valuable insights into comprehending and addressing this ancient Indian medical tradition's understanding of jwaras."
1285,"A patient suffering from vatapittaja variety of jwara desires for cold things, while, a patient suffering from jwara caused by vata and kapha dosha longs for hot things. However, when both of these types of doshas get mixed then such patient manifests both the kinds of symptoms. [37-38]","In the complexities of disease manifestation, contrasting desires can signal different underlying imbalances. A patient battling jwara caused by vatapittaja seeks cool relief, while one afflicted by vata-kapha jwara craves warmth. However, when both these doshas intermingle, the symptoms become a paradoxical mix of both kinds, presenting a challenge to personalize treatment and alleviate suffering, as outlined in Ayurvedic texts like [37-38]."
1286,Vata dosha is exceedingly yogavahi (which accentuates the properties of others) in nature. It produces both type of effects on combination with the two doshas. On combining with tejas it produces burning sensation while in combination with soma it produces cooling effect. [38-39],"In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, Vata dosha, one of the three fundamental energies, is believed to have a unique quality - it has the ability to enhance the properties of other substances or entities it comes in contact with. This quality, known as yogavahi, makes Vata dosha quite fascinating. When combined with Tejas (or fire element), Vata dosha can produce a burning sensation, and when mixed with Soma (or water element), it creates a cooling effect. Thus, the combination of Vata dosha with different elements can have varied effects on the body and mind."
1287,"Excessive burning sensation inside the body, morbid thirst, delirium, dyspnea, giddiness, pain in bones and joints, absence of sweating, non-excretion of doshas and the feces – are the clinical features of antarvegi jwara (internal manifestation of jwara).  Excessive rise in the body temperature and above features in mild form are the features of bahirvegi (external type of jwara) and this type of jwara is easily curable. [39-41]","The internal manifestation of fever, known as antarvegi jwara, brings about a host of severe symptoms within the body. These include an intense burning sensation, extreme thirst, delirious behavior, shortness of breath, dizziness, and excruciating pain in the bones and joints. One striking feature is the absence of sweating, along with the non-excretion of doshas and feces. On the other hand, bahirvegi jwara, the external type of fever, presents milder symptoms such as a more moderate rise in body temperature accompanied by some of these features. The treatise suggests that this form of fever is more easily curable, offering hope for those afflicted with its symptoms."
1288,"Jwara manifesting in the vasanta or spring season and sharada or autumn season is called prakrita (seasonal) jwara and is easily curable.   Pitta gets aggravated during autumn season because of its inherent hot properties and hot environment. Kapha gets accumulated in winters and gets aggravated during spring season.   The water and drugs (including the eatables) become sour in vipaka (taste that emerges after digestion) during the rainy season, which results in the accumulation of pitta. ","In the realm of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, jwara or fever is classified into different types based on its manifestation and root cause. The prakrita jwara, which occurs during the vasanta or spring season and sharada or autumn season, is considered to be seasonal and easily curable. Interestingly, the underlying causes of this type of fever are closely linked to the inherent properties of the seasons. During the autumn season, pitta - one of the three doshas or biological energies in the body - gets aggravated due to its hot properties and the hot environment. Similarly, during the spring season, kapha - another dosha - gets accumulated in winters and gets aggravated, leading to fever. Furthermore, the rainy season brings about a change in the vipaka or taste that emerges after digestion, causing the accumulation of pitta and ultimately resulting in jwara."
1289,"This accumulated pitta gets aggravated or excited (by the hot sunrays) during the autumn season. This can immediately produce jwara in which kapha dosha is secondarily associated. As vasanta is the part of visarga kala (the time of year when, body has good strength imparted by nature), no problem is created by fasting.  ","During the autumn season, the built-up pitta in our bodies becomes particularly active and irritated due to the intensified heat of the sun. This aggravated pitta can directly result in jwara or fever, with kapha dosha being indirectly involved. However, as vasanta is a part of visarga kala, when our natural strength is at its peak, undergoing a period of fasting during this time can actually be beneficial for the body and cause no harm."
1290,"During hemanta (early winter) the water and drugs (including eatables) become sweet in taste, which helps in accumulation of kapha. This kapha gets aggravated during the subsequent spring season due to the strong sunrays (which melt this kapha). Therefore, jwara caused by kapha is manifested during the spring season. The spring is the part of the adana kala (the time when the strength of the creatures is the least as the nature withdraws the strength) and in the jwara caused in this period vata and pitta dosha constitute the secondary associates.  ","In the early winter season, known as hemanta, the natural world undergoes changes that have significant implications for an individual's health. The waters and foods develop a heightened sweetness, which contributes to the build-up of kapha in the body. As the following spring arrives, the intensified sunrays cause the accumulated kapha to liquefy, leading to a fever that is characterized as jwara. It is worth noting that this particular seasonal jwara is a manifestation of adana kala, a period when nature withholds its energy and weakens all living beings. During this time, vata and pitta dosha play a secondary role in the progression of the illness caused by kapha imbalance."
1291,"A patient of jwara should be treated keeping in view the strength of the doshas in the beginning, middle and the end of the spring and autumn seasons. This way, depending upon the nature of the seasons, the seasonal types of jwara are described. ","In the context of managing jwara, or fever, in patients, it is crucial to consider the strength of the doshas at the onset, peak, and conclusion of the spring and autumn seasons. This approach allows for a more tailored treatment plan that takes into account the seasonal influences on the body and the specific manifestation of the fever during these times. By doing so, healthcare practitioners can effectively address the unique seasonal types of jwara and promote optimal health outcomes for their patients."
1292,"Generally, the jwara caused by vata dosha is difficult to treat in every season. The other types of jwara, get their initial strength from the predominant season, those are (Vaikrita jwara) difficult to treat are: vatika jwara irrespective of its season of occurrence paitika jwara occurring in seasons other than autumn and kaphaja jwara occurring in seasons other than spring. The causative factors of the different types of jwara have been described in Nidana Sthana (in jwara). [42-49]","Fever, or jwara, is a common ailment with various causes and forms. According to Ayurvedic texts, fevers caused by an aggravation of the vata dosha are challenging to treat in any season. On the other hand, fevers known as vaikrita jwara, paitika jwara, and kaphaja jwara get their initial strength from the predominant season but become particularly difficult to treat when they occur in unexpected seasons. These seasonal variations in fever manifestations and complexities are described in detail in the Nidana Sthana section of Ayurvedic literature, offering insights into their causes and potential treatments."
1293,"Jwara is easily curable if it occurs in a person with strong physique, or if it is caused by the vitiation of lesser amount of dosha and if there are no complications.Jwara having the following characteristics are incurable and lead to death – Which is caused by either greater amount of / strong etiological factors Which manifests with many clinical features Which destroys the sense organs immediately. Tikshna jwara (severe, associated with delirium, giddiness and breathlessness causes death of the patient either on the seventh, tenth or twelfth day. Jwara occurring in a weak and emaciated person (kshina), associated with edema (shunasya), seated in deeper body tissues (gambhira), severe (balvan) and that occurring for very long durations (dirgha ratrika) are incurable ones. The jwara in which, the mid hair part of scalp becomes visible, is also considered incurable (kesha simanta krita).[49-53]","In the ancient Indian medical text, Charaka Samhita, the curability of Jwara (fever) is discussed. A fever that strikes an individual with a robust physique or one caused by a mild dosha imbalance can be easily cured if there are no complications. However, certain types of fevers are deemed incurable and potentially fatal. These include fevers caused by potent etiological factors, manifesting with numerous symptoms, and rapidly affecting the senses. Specifically, Tikshna Jwara, marked by severe symptoms, delirium, giddiness, and breathlessness, leads to the patient's death on the seventh, tenth, or twelfth day. Fevers occurring in weak and emaciated individuals, accompanied by edema, deeply rooted in body tissues, extremely severe, and lasting for extended periods are also considered incurable. Additionally, a fever causing the mid-hair part of the scalp to become visible is deemed uncurable, indicating a grave prognosis."
1294,"The aggravated dosha circulate through the channels carrying rasa (the first nutritional dhatu equivalent to plasma) and spread all over the body and gets stagnated, causes santata jwara. This santata jwara is extremely difficult to treat and manifests its symptoms very quickly. In this type  the patient either gets cured (on the pacification of dosha) or killed (on the further aggravation of dosha) on the 10th, 12th or 7th day. T","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, a santata jwara is a severe type of fever that arises when aggravated doshas, or bodily humors, circulate through the channels carrying rasa, the nutritional equivalent to plasma. As these doshas spread throughout the body and become stagnated, they cause a highly infectious and rapidly progressing fever. This intense fever can lead to two outcomes: either a complete cure on the 10th, 12th or 7th day with the pacification of the aggravated doshas, or unfortunately, death if the doshas continue to escalate in severity. The treatment for this type of fever is extremely challenging due to its rapid and intense nature."
1295,"he dosha involved in the manifestation of santata jwara is in accordance with season (kala), vitiated factors (dushya), and the physical constitution of the patient (prakriti) due to which it is nispratyanika (having no opponent / which cannot be inhibited). Thus, it is known to be unbearable.  ","The manifestation of chronic fever, or ""santata jwara,"" is a complex phenomenon that depends on various factors, according to Ayurvedic traditions. This dosha, or bodily humor, arises in response to the season (kala), the specific factors that have been vitiated (dushya), and the individual's unique physical constitution (prakriti). Due to this intricate interplay, santata jwara becomes nispratyanika - unopposed and unable to be inhibited by conventional means. As a result, those afflicted with chronic fever experience an intensity of symptoms that can be unbearable, further emphasizing the need for personalized and holistic approaches to treatment in Ayurvedic medicine."
1296,"Additionally, the other dhatu, urine, stool and vata etc. dosha, also get affected simultaneously in this fever. If the involved factors like rasa are purified optimally the fever gets subsided in either 7 or 10 or 12 days, otherwise, the fever kills the patient within that period. ","In the context of fever, other affected bodily components include urine, feces, and the vata dosha. According to a Sanskrit verse translation, optimal purification of factors such as rasa can result in a subsiding of the fever within 7, 10, or 12 days. However, without this purification, the fever has the potential to become fatal for the patient within that same timeframe."
1297,"If, some of the 12 constituents of this fever get purified, while some others remain unpurified, then the fever goes in latent stage on the 12th day and reappears on the 13th day and may persist for  longer duration. In this way, a physician should understand the causes and features of this type of fever and should initiate the treatment only after a proper understanding of these factors, mostly by the methods beginning with apatarpana. [53-61]","Understanding the complex nature of fevers is crucial for effective treatment, as outlined in this ancient Sanskrit text. If some of the twelve contributing factors are purified while others remain unaddressed, the fever may recede only to reemerge and potentially prolong. A physician must carefully analyze the causes and characteristics of such a fever before initiating therapy. The recommended approach often involves methods beginning with apatarpana, highlighting the importance of a personalized and thorough treatment plan."
1298,"The aggravated dosha when generally lodges in the rakta dhatu, then they manifest with fever twice in 24 hours (Nycthemeron) depending on the time of dosha aggravation or subsidence. The dosha in this type of jwara can be counteracted. [61-62]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, an aggravated dosha, when it lodges in the rakta dhatu or the blood tissue, gives rise to a specific type of fever known as jwara. This unique condition is characterized by the manifestation of fever twice in a 24-hour period, with the occurrence depending on the time of dosha aggravation or subsidence. The Sanskrit verse 61-62 from ancient Ayurvedic texts sheds light on this phenomenon and offers hope for counteraction through appropriate interventions aimed at pacifying the aggravated dosha in question."
1299,"Vitiated dosha produce anyedushka type of jwara with the support of any one factor amongst the kala (time), prakriti (physical constitution) and dushya (vitiated factors) leading to obstruction in  medo vaha sira (the channel of circulation of medasa (fat)). It can be counteracted. This jwara occurs only once during day and night. [63-64]","The Sanskrit verse reveals the manifestation of a specific fever type, known as ""anyedushka,"" caused by the corruption of doshas or bodily humors. This condition is aggravated by the support of one contributing factor, which could be time (kala), physical constitution (prakriti), or vitiated factors (dushya). The obstruction in the medo vaha sira, the channel responsible for fat circulation, results in this fever type. However, the verse offers a ray of hope as it suggests that this jwara, appearing only once during day and night, can be effectively counteracted with appropriate medical intervention or natural remedies."
1300,"When the dosha afflict the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and majja dhatu (bone marrow), they cause the tritiyaka and chaturthaka jwara respectively. Some scholars opine that the different types of jwara viz the anyedushaka, tritiyaka and chaturthaka jwara manifest because of the affliction of the some alternate dhatu by the dosha. Anyedushyaka jwara is caused by the affliction of rakta dhatu (blood) also. ","The ancient Sanskrit text, ""Charaka Samhita,"" describes the manifestation of specific fever types due to the affliction of various dosha on different dhatu. Of particular interest are the tritiyaka and chaturthaka jwara, which arise from the influence of dosha on asthi (bone tissue) and majja dhatu (bone marrow) respectively. Some scholars interpret these specific fever types to be the result of alternate dhatu affliction by the dosha. The anyedushaka jwara is an additional type, caused by the impairment of rakta dhatu (blood), further highlighting the connection between bodily tissues and fever manifestations in this ancient medical system."
1301,"Tritiyaka jwara manifests when the dosha afflict the mamsa dhatu (muscular tissues). Dosha lodging in the channels of circulation of medo dhatu cause chaturthaka jwara. Anyedushka jwara occurs every day, while tritiyaka jwara occurs after a gap of one day and chaurthaka occurs after two days gap. [64-67]","The Sanskrit verse elucidates the manifestation of three types of fever, or ""jwara,"" in the human body. The ""tritiyaka jwara"" arises when the ""dosha"" or humors disturb the muscular tissues, known as ""mamsa dhatu."" On the other hand, ""chaturthaka jwara"" is caused by the lodging of dosha in the channels of circulation of medo dhatu, which refers to adipose tissue. The third type, ""anyedushka jwara,"" occurs daily, while ""tritiyaka jwara"" appears after a gap of one day and ""chaturthaka jwara"" after two days. This ancient medical wisdom offers a unique perspective on the correlation between bodily humors, tissues, and fever patterns."
1302,"As a seed remains dormant in the soil and germinates at a favorable time, similarly the doshas remain in dormant condition in the dhatu and get aggravated at a favorable time. These dosha gain strength at an appropriate time and when the power of the inhibiting (disease preventing) factors has subsided, then the tritiyaka and chaturthaka jwara manifest.  The dosha lose their strength after manifesting their signs and symptoms of aggravation and get lodged in their respective places. They again get aggravated and afflict the person with jwara.  ","In the human body, just as a seed lies dormant in the soil, waiting for the right conditions to germinate, so too do the doshas lay dormant within the tissues. At an appropriate time, when inhibiting factors are weakened, these dormant doshas become aggravated and gain strength. This can lead to the manifestation of diseases such as tritiyaka and chaturthaka jwara. After showing signs and symptoms of aggravation, the doshas lose their strength and return to their respective places, only to become aggravated again and afflict the individual with jwara. This cycle highlights the delicate balance of the doshas within the human body and the importance of maintaining this balance to prevent disease."
1303,The tritiyaka jwara manifests in three types –   When the kapha and pitta dosha are aggravated then it afflicts the trika pradesh (sacral region) When the vata and kapha dosha are aggravated then the back (prishtha) region are affected The head region is affected in the case of aggravation of vata and pitta dosha. Similarly chaturthaka jwara is also of two types –   Calf region is afflicted in the in the beginning by the vitiation of kapha Head region is afflicted in the beginning by the vitiation of vata. [70-72],"The Sanskrit verse elucidates on the manifestation of disorders in the human body, specifically the fever conditions known as tritiyaka jwara and chaturthaka jwara. In the case of tritiyaka jwara, the sacral region is affected when both kapha and pitta doshas are aggravated. Conversely, the back region is targeted when vata and kapha doshas are disturbed. The head region, on the other hand, bears the brunt of aggravated vata and pitta doshas. Similarly, chaturthaka jwara emerges in two ways – initially affecting the calf region due to kapha vitiation, and the head region due to vata disturbance. These ancient medical insights highlight the intricate relationship between the human body's constitution and environmental factors, offering a unique perspective on holistic health and well-being."
1304,"Chaturthaka viparyaya jwara is another variety of vishama jwara. Each of the three dosha i.e. vata, pitta and kapha cause this disease by afflicting the two dhatu viz asthi (bone) and majja (bone marrow).[73]","In the realm of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, Chaturthaka viparyaya jwara is a distinct type of vishama jwara, or irregular fever. This particular disorder is caused by the disturbance of the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - which specifically affect two particular bodily tissues: asthi (bone) and majja (bone marrow). This time-tested knowledge from the Sanskrit text sheds light on the interconnectedness of the human body's elements and the importance of maintaining balance for optimal health."
1305,"These five types of jwara are mostly caused by sannipata (simultaneous vitiation of the three dosha), however, the dosha, which is predominant among the three doshas is generally attributed as the causative factors. [74]","The ancient Sanskrit text, the Ayurvedic classic, identifies five types of fever or jwara, which are primarily caused by the rare and dangerous simultaneous vitiation of all three doshas, known as sannipata. However, it is generally acknowledged that the dosha that holds predominance among the three is regarded as the leading cause of the onset of fever in an individual. This crucial concept in Ayurveda provides valuable insights into the workings of this traditional Indian medical system and its understanding of the human body's delicate balance."
1306,"Manifestation of jwara at a particular time or a change in the time of manifestation takes place due to following factors: Jwara occurs according to the strength or weakness of factors like dosha, seasons, day, night, mental status and artha (deeds of previous life). ","The appearance of fever, or jwara, at a specific time or its alteration is influenced by various factors. At the core of these influences are the balance of bodily humors, or dosha, the changing seasons, and the daily cycles of day and night. Additionally, one's mental state and past karma, or artha, also play a significant role in determining the onset and course of this feverish condition. Understanding these factors can help guide appropriate interventions and promote overall well-being."
1307,"Manifestation of jwara in the different dhatu (body tissues):  When the vitiated dosha are located in the rasa dhatu, the clinical features manifesting are – heaviness, miserable feeling, anxiety, exhaustion, vomiting, anorexia, increase in external temperature, body ache and yawning. ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, jwara or fever is believed to be caused by the aggravation of dosha (the three vital energies in the body) and their manifestation in different body tissues or dhatus. According to this ancient Indian healing system, when the vitiated dosha are situated in the rasa dhatu or the nutritive fluid that nourishes the body, it results in a specific set of symptoms. These include feelings of heaviness and discomfort, a miserable feeling, anxiety, exhaustion, loss of appetite, increased body temperature, vomiting, body aches, and excessive yawning. This is the body's way of communicating that there is an imbalance in the rasa dhatu that needs to be addressed in order to restore health and balance."
1308,"The vitiated doshas causing jwara are located in the rakta dhatu, the clinical features are – Increase in body temperature, eruptions, thirst, frequent spitting mixed with blood burning sensation, discoloration, giddiness, intoxication and incoherent speech. ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, jwara or fever is a condition that occurs due to the aggravation of doshas - vitiated Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, when these doshas get imbalanced and locate in the rakta dhatu (blood tissue), they manifest as jwara or fever. The clinical features of this condition include a rise in body temperature, skin eruptions, excessive thirst, frequent spitting with blood-tinged mucus, a burning sensation throughout the body, discoloration, giddiness, and symptoms of intoxication and incoherent speech. These symptoms highlight the severity of the imbalance in the doshas, which require immediate attention and treatment to restore balance and maintain optimal health."
1309,"Burning sensation inside the body, thirst, unconsciousness, weakness, diarrhea, foul smell from the body and throwing movement of the limbs are the features manifesting when the doshas causing jwara are lodged in the mamsa dhatu. ","The ancient Sanskrit text describes a set of symptoms known as ""jwara"" that occur when the doshas, or bodily humors, disrupt the tissue known as ""mamsa dhatu."" According to the translation, one may experience a burning sensation inside the body, intense thirst, unconsciousness, weakness, diarrhea, a foul smell emanating from the body, and involuntary limb movements. These symptoms suggest that the body is undergoing significant distress, indicating the need for appropriate medical intervention to restore balance and health."
1310,"Vitiated dosha located in the meda dhatu present with the following clinical features – excessive sweating, thirst, incoherent speech, frequent emesis, inability to tolerate the smell of one’s own body, wet feeling in the body and anorexia. ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, a vitiated dosha in the meda dhatu (fatty tissue) manifests with a specific set of clinical features. These symptoms include excessive sweating, heightened thirst, disoriented speech patterns, frequent bouts of vomiting, an aversion to one's own body odor, a wet or clammy sensation in the body, and a loss of appetite. This unique combination of signs points to an imbalance in the doshas that has accumulated within the fatty tissues, leading to disturbances in the overall health and well-being of the individual."
1311,"Vitiated dosha located in the asthi dhatu cause the following clinical features – diarrhea, emesis, pain in the bones, production of kujana (a sort of cooing sound) convulsive movements of the body and limbs. ","In the context of Ayurveda, a ancient Indian system of medicine, a verse from a Sanskrit text describes the impact of vitiated dosha in the asthi dhatu, or bone tissue. According to the translation, when the dosha are out of balance in this tissue, it can result in a range of clinical features including diarrhea, vomiting, bone pain, the production of a cooing sound known as kujana, and convulsive movements of the body and limbs. This highlights the interconnectedness of the bodily systems in Ayurvedic theory and the importance of maintaining balance within them."
1312,"When the vitiated dosha are located in the majja dhatu then the following signs and symptoms appear – hiccup, bronchitis, cough, feeling of entering into darkness frequently, cutting pain in the vital organs (marmas), feeling of cold externally and internal burning sensation. ","The Sanskrit verse, when translated, reveals crucial insights into the symptoms associated with the presence of vitiated dosha in the majja dhatu. According to Ayurvedic principles, this can lead to a range of issues including hiccups, bronchitis, and cough. Moreover, a person may experience a constant feeling of entering darkness, cutting pain in vital organs, and a strange combination of cold externally and internal burning sensation. This knowledge underscores the importance of maintaining balance in the body's dosha and dhatu for overall health and well-being."
1313,"Vitiated dosha causing jwara located in the sukra dhatu cause ejaculation and destruction of shukra resulting in the extinction of life along with vayu, agni and soma of the subtle body (sukshma sharira). ","The balance of bodily humors is crucial for maintaining overall health, and any vitiation in this delicate system can lead to serious consequences. According to Ayurvedic texts, an imbalance in dosha, specifically located in the reproductive tissue or shukra dhatu, can cause fever and ultimately result in ejaculation and the destruction of shukra. This, in turn, brings about the extinction of life, affecting vital energies such as vayu (wind), agni (fire), and soma (moon) in the subtle body. This profound Sanskrit verse underscores the interconnectedness of various systems within the human body and highlights the importance of maintaining harmony among all bodily components for longevity and well-being."
1314,"The jwara in which doshas are located in the rasa, rakta, mamsa and meda dhatu are curable, while those in which the location is in the asthi and majja dhatu are difficult to treat. The jwara in which the vitiated dosha are located in shukra dhatu is incurable. [75-83]","Fever, or jwara, taking hold in the bodily tissues of rasa, rakta, mamsa, and meda presents as a curable condition, according to Ayurvedic texts. Conversely, fever manifesting in the asthi and majja dhatu poses a more challenging treatment prospect. However, should fever infiltrate the shukra dhatu, the prognosis turns grim, with traditional sources deeming it as incurable."
1315,"Signs and symptoms of jwara by combination of vata and pitta: In Nidana Sthana the eight varieties of jwara along with their causative factors, signs and symptoms have been described in brief. ","In the ancient Indian medical text, Nidana Sthana, the concept of jwara (fever) is explored in depth. Of particular interest is the combination of vata and pitta, which can give rise to a unique set of symptoms. The signs of this type of jwara may include a rapid onset, high fever, intense thirst, sweating, and a burning sensation in the body. Additionally, those affected may experience anxiety, delirium, or hallucinations. Understanding these distinct characteristics is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment in the Ayurvedic medical system."
1316,"Now their signs and symptoms will be described in detail: Headache, breaking pain in joints, burning sensation, horripilation, dryness of throat and mouth, nausea, thirst, fainting, giddiness, anorexia, sleeplessness, talkativeness and yawning – all these are the signs and symptoms of jwara by combination of vata and pitta. ","Jwara, a common ailment in Ayurvedic medicine, is characterized by a combination of vata and pitta doshas. According to the ancient Sanskrit text, the symptoms of this condition include severe headaches, shooting pain in the joints, a burning sensation throughout the body, goosebumps, dryness in the throat and mouth, queasiness, excessive thirst, fainting spells, dizziness, loss of appetite, insomnia, excessive talking, and constant yawning. Understanding these signs and symptoms is crucial in diagnosing and treating jwara effectively."
1317,"Signs and symptoms of jwara by combination of vata and kapha: Feeling cold, heaviness, drowsiness, timidity, pain in joints, feeling of stiffness of head (sirograha), coryza, cough, impaired sweating and moderate rise in temperature are the signs and symptoms of jwara caused by vata and kapha. ","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, jwara, or fever, can manifest through various combinations of doshas. When vata and kapha join forces, they unleash a unique set of symptoms that include feeling cold, even in warm environments. Heaviness and drowsiness may also settle in, accompanied by timidity and a heightened sense of stiffness in the head. Aching joints and an impaired sweating response add to the discomfort, while coryza and cough signal respiratory involvement. Throughout this ordeal, a moderate rise in temperature may be present, hardly climbing to alarming heights, but persistent enough to drain the body's vitality."
1318,"Signs and symptoms of jwara by combination of kapha and pitta: Frequently changing sensation of hot and cold, frequent increased or decreased sweating, delusions, cough, anorexia, thirst, elimination of phlegm and bile, coating and bitterness in the mouth and drowsiness – all are the clinical features of jwara caused by kapha and pitta. Thus, here the features of different types of jwara caused by the simultaneous vitiation of two dosha have been described. [84-89]","Jwara, or fever, is a common ailment discussed in Ayurvedic medicine, with various symptoms depending on the combination of doshas involved. When kapha and pitta are simultaneously vitiated, the individual may experience frequent sensations of hot and cold, as well as changes in sweat patterns. Delusions, coughing, loss of appetite, thirst, and elimination of phlegm and bile are also possible. A coating and bitterness in the mouth, along with drowsiness, further indicate this specific type of jwara. This combination highlights the unique symptoms that can arise from different dosha combinations, showcasing the complexity and individualized nature of Ayurvedic medicine."
1319,"Description of sannipataja jwara (caused by combined tridosha): The sannipataja variety of jwara, has thirteen sub types have been described in Nidana Sthana. ","The sannipataja jwara is a formidable type of fever, as described in the Nidana Sthana of Ayurvedic texts. It is caused by the simultaneous aggravation of all three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha. This imbalance results in a highly potent fever that has thirteen distinct subtypes, each with its own unique clinical manifestations. The severity of sannipataja jwara makes it critical to seek early intervention and appropriate Ayurvedic treatment to restore the balance of doshas and ensure optimal health."
1320,"Now the clinical features of each type will be described separately:  Sannipataja jwara in which vata and pitta are codominant while kapha is recessive has the following clinical features – giddiness, thirst, burning sensation, heaviness and excessive headache. [91] ","In the exploration of Ayurvedic teachings, we find that the Sannipataja jwara type presents a unique set of clinical features. This particular condition is marked by the codominant factors of vata and pitta, while kapha takes a backseat. The resulting symptoms offer insights into the body's responses when these doshas become imbalanced. Notably, patients with Sannipataja jwara often experience giddiness, an increased thirst, a persistent burning sensation, feelings of heaviness, and severe headaches that surpass typical levels of discomfort. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for tailoring appropriate treatment strategies in Ayurvedic medicine."
1321,"Sannipataja jwara in which vata and kapha are codominant while pitta is recessive has the following clinical features – Coldness, cough, anorexia, drowsiness, thirst, burning sensation and pain. [92]","The Sannipataja jwara, a type of fever that is commonly seen in Ayurvedic medicine, is characterized by the co-dominance of vata and kapha doshas, with pitta playing a recessive role.

1336, Urticaria and bluish – black or reddish circular patches appear on the skin Patient speaks less or unable to speak Inflammation of srotasa Heaviness in the abdomen The doshas undergo paka after a very long time (conversion into the healthy state of the doshas do not occur early). [103-109],"According to ancient Sanskrit texts, a person suffering from certain skin conditions, such as urticaria and the appearance of bluish-black or reddish circular patches on the skin, may also experience speech difficulties. This could be due to inflammation in the srotasa, which are the channels of communication and transportation within the body. Additionally, the individual may feel a heavy sensation in the abdomen, indicating an imbalance in the doshas, or bodily energies. Interestingly, it is noted that the conversion of these imbalanced doshas into a healthy state takes place after a very long time, suggesting a prolonged recovery period for this particular condition (verses 103-109)."
1337,"If there is obstruction (or non – elimination) of the dosha, the agnis are completely destroyed and if all the signs and symptoms are fully manifested, then sannipata jwara is incurable; otherwise it is treatable with difficulty.  The clinical features of jwaras caused by the individual doshas vata, pitta and kapha have been described separately in the Nidana Sthana. From these sign and symptoms, the features of dwandaja types and the sannipataja types can be known and decided. [109-110]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the translation of this ancient Sanskrit verse holds significant implications for diagnosing and treating fever, or jwara. The verse highlights that if the doshas, or bodily humors, are not properly eliminated, it can lead to the destruction of the digestive fires and result in a severe type of fever known as sannipata jwara. This form of fever is considered incurable when all signs and symptoms are fully manifested, but with great difficulty, it can be treated if diagnosed and managed at an earlier stage. The Nidana Sthana provides separate descriptions of jwaras caused by the individual doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - which can aid in identifying the characteristics of more complex fever types such as dwandaja and sannipataja."
1338,"The eighth type of jwara i.e. agantuja type (that caused due to external/exogenous factors) is of four types, viz: abhihataja, abhishangaja, abhicharaja and abhishapaja.[111]","In the realm of Ayurveda, jwara or fever takes on many forms, each with its own unique causes and symptoms. The eighth type of jwara, known as agantuja, is particularly noteworthy as it arises from external or exogenous factors. This category of fever can be further broken down into four distinct subtypes: abhihataja, caused by physical trauma; abhishangaja, triggered by exposure to cold; abhicharaja, the result of negative energy or curses; and abhishapaja, induced by inauspicious planetary influences. Understanding these different types of agantuja jwara is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies and restoring balance to the body and mind."
1339,"The jwara caused by the injury from weapons, stones, hunters, wood, fist, palm of the sole, teeth and such other things is called abhighataja. In this type, vitiated vata affects predominantly rakta (blood) to resulting in jwara with discomfort, swelling, discoloration and pain.[112-114]","The Sanskrit verse reveals the concept of ""abhighataja"" jwara, a fever caused by various external injuries. Weapons, stones, or even hunters can induce this fever. Interestingly, it also includes less obvious sources such as wood, fist, and the palm of the sole, emphasizing the broadness of potential causes. Central to this type of fever is the aggravation of vata dosha, which primarily affects the blood (rakta). This disturbance leads to fever accompanied by discomfort, swelling, and pain, with subsequent discoloration in the affected area."
1340,"Abhishangaja jwara: Jwara caused by the affliction of passion, grief, fear, anger and evil spirits including germs is called abhishangaja jwara. ","In the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, illnesses such as fever are not just seen as physical ailments but are also connected to mental and emotional states. The term ""Abhishangaja Jwara"" refers to this concept, where fever is caused by afflictions such as passion, grief, fear, anger, and even evil spirits, including germs. This Sanskrit verse highlights the interconnectedness of our body, mind, and emotions, acknowledging that external factors and internal imbalances can both contribute to the manifestation of a physical illness."
1341,"Vata gets aggravated by passion, grief and fear, while pitta is aggravated by anger and all the three doshas are afflicted by bhootas (evil spirits or germs). ","In the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, the delicate balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - is crucial for maintaining optimal health. Of these, Vata is particularly sensitive to external stimuli, being easily aggravated by passion, grief, and fear. Pitta, on the other hand, is more susceptible to internal factors, with anger being a primary cause of its imbalance. However, all three doshas can be affected by the presence of bhootas or germs, underlining the importance of maintaining a clean and hygienic lifestyle to ensure their optimal functioning."
1342,"Simultaneously, the signs and symptoms of the respective type of bhoota are described here. In the bhutadhikara section, the characteristic features of eight types of bhoota are described.","In the exploration of the esoteric realm of bhootas, the ancient Sanskrit text delves into the distinct symptoms and characteristics of each of the eight types. The bhutadhikara section serves as a comprehensive guide, describing in detail the unique feature of each bhoota, allowing practitioners to identify and understand them better. This knowledge is crucial for initiates on the spiritual path, providing them with the keys to navigate the subtle energies that permeate the universe."
1343,Some acharyas opine that the jwara caused by the contact of the poisonous air of the toxic plants and other such toxins is called abhishangaja jwara. This type of jwara gets cured by the administration of antidotes of this poison. ,"In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, some scholars, known as acharyas, have made significant contributions to our understanding of various diseases and their treatments. One such concept is the idea of abhishangaja jwara, or fever caused by poisonous air. This type of fever occurs when one comes into contact with toxic plants or other harmful substances, resulting in the body being exposed to poison. According to these acharyas, administering an antidote that specifically targets the poison can help to alleviate and cure this type of fever. This important teaching highlights the value of understanding the root cause of a disease in order to develop effective treatments, and underscores the deep knowledge and expertise of Ayurvedic scholars."
1344,"Abhicharaja jwara: The activities such as abhichara (evil tantrik rituals) and abhishapa of siddhas (curse by saints who have attained spiritual perfection) results in the manifestation of sannipataja jwara, which are respectively called abhicharaja and abhishapaja jwara respectively.","In the ancient scriptures of Sanskrit, there are descriptions of specific fever types that result from powerful rituals. Two such instances are Abhicharaja Jwara and Abhishapaja Jwara. The former is a fever caused by the malevolent practices of abhichara - evil tantrik rituals. The latter is a consequence of the curse (abhishapa) from siddhas, who have attained spiritual perfection. These spiritual forces are believed to create a sannipataja jwara, which translates to 'a fever brought about by the conjunction of various causes.' This ancient knowledge highlights the power attributed to spiritual practices in shaping physical health."
1345,"These types of jwara are intolerable and the clinical features of sannipata jwara manifest in them accompanied by other clinical features of the mind, sense organs and body due to the cause afflicting. ","In the realm of Ayurveda, few ailments are as formidable as the Sannipata Jwara, a fever that is both intense and unyielding. The clinical features of this condition are not only severe but are also accompanied by disturbances in the mind, senses, and body. This makes it an intolerable ordeal for those who are afflicted by it. Such is the power of Sannipata Jwara that it can overshadow all other clinical manifestations, making it the primary focus of diagnosis and treatment. The cause behind this fever deeply embeds itself into the system, affecting the overall health and well-being of the individual, thereby emphasizing the importance of addressing not just the symptoms but also the root cause for effective management and recovery."
1346,"Abhishapaja jwara, abhicharaja and abhishapdaja jwara can be ascertained from the following clinical features –   Either by the direct observation of the performance of the tantric rituals and shapa (curse) By hearing from others about it By inference (anumana) about it from some feature and By the alleviation of jwara after counteracting their effects. ","In the realm of Ayurveda, ancient Indian medicine, there exists a classification of fever known as Abhishapaja Jwara, Abhicharaja Jwara, and Abhishapdaja Jwara. These unique conditions can be determined through various clinical features, including direct observation of tantric rituals and curses being performed, hearing about such events from others, or inferring their occurrence based on certain observable features. Furthermore, the alleviation of fever after counteracting the effects of these ailments serves as another key indicator in their identification."
1347,"Depending upon the varieties of abhichara and abhishapa, tantric and disease occurred by curse are there, clinical features also vary. A through understanding is essential for the diagnosis of such varieties of diseases.   ","In the study of tantric practices and malevolent curses, known as abhichara and abhishapa respectively, it is crucial to understand the various manifestations of these forces. The symptoms of a disease caused by a curse can differ greatly depending on the type of curse and the intentions behind it. For example, a tantric curse may produce different effects than a non-tantric one. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these practices is essential for accurately diagnosing and treating such diseases. By recognizing the unique characteristics of each type of abhichara and abhishapa, healthcare practitioners can better assess their patients' conditions and provide appropriate care."
1348,"Jwara of psychological origin are further described as:-  Kamaja jwara - Dhyana (constantly thinking of same object), frequent sighs of lament are the clinical features of jwara caused by kama (passion) Shokaja jwara - Excessive crying is the clinical presentation of jwara caused by grief. Bhayaja jwara - Patient generally feels himself threatened in the jwara caused by fear. Krodhaj jwara - Patient is agitated excessively in the jwara caused by anger. ","In the realm of psychological origins, fever or Jwara manifests with distinct characteristics depending upon the underlying emotion. When driven by passion, an individual may experience continuous ideation and frequent sighs, a condition recognized as Kamaja Jwara. The onset of Shokaja Jwara is marked by excessive crying, indicative of grief's overwhelming grasp. In Bhayaja Jwara, the patient experiences feelings of constant threat and fear that permeate their consciousness. Lastly, Krodhaj Jwara is distinguished by uncontrolled agitation, mirroring the intense anger consuming the individual's psyche."
1349,"Para psychic manifestations are also presented in the jwara due to affliction by the bhootas (evil spirits). Jwara caused by visha (intoxications) is associated with the features of fainting, unconsciousness, intoxication and fatigue. ","In the realm of disease, jwara or fever takes on added dimensions as it manifests not just through physiological imbalances but also at a para psychic level. When bhootas, often translated as evil spirits, afflict an individual, they can trigger these heightened fever states. Conversely, jwara can be caused by visha, or intoxicants, leading to symptoms such as fainting, unconsciousness, intense inebriation, and debilitating fatigue. This deeper exploration of jwara reveals the multifaceted nature of this common ailment, shedding light on its psychic and toxicological aspects."
1350,"In some jwara, fever appears first and then the signs and symptoms of kama etc. as described above are manifested, and it may happen the other way also. The specific features of kama etc. as described in the context of jwara are also applicable to other diseases caused by these factors (as unmada etc.). In kama jwara etc. the mind is first afflicted by passion etc. but the jwara does not manifest until the doshas as vata, pitta, kapha of the body are not vitiated. Similarly, the vitiation of the doshas in the body also does not gain enough strength to produce jwara unless the mind is afflicted by these factors (kama, chinta etc.)  The jwara caused by external causes are at first independent but later they get mixed up with the signs and symptoms of nija jwara (endogenous fevers). However, these agantuja jwaras have their own etiological factors and treatments. [114-129]","In the context of certain feverish conditions, or jwaras, the initial appearance of a fever might signal the onset of deeper underlying passions or mental disturbances, such as kama, or desire. Conversely, these same mental factors can also manifest as symptoms of disease once the bodily humors, or doshas, have become aggravated. In the case of both kamaja jwara and other ailments caused by similar internal factors, the mind and body are inextricably linked, with each affecting the other. External causes of fever, known as agantuja jwaras, may present independently at first, but will eventually become entangled with the symptoms of endogenous fevers. Despite this interplay, these external fevers possess their own unique etiologies and require specific treatments to be effectively addressed."
1351,"These aggravated dosha either alone or in the combination of two or three, spread along with the rasa dhatu (the first dhatu responsible for nourishment of the body) and displace the jatharagni from its own place. Supplemented by the dosha’s own heat and the heat of the jatharagni, the heat of the body gets accentuated and they are further aggravated by the blockage of the circulatory channels. It then pervades the entire body to produce excessive heat. Therefore, the temperature increases all over the body and this condition is called jwara.[129-132]","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, an imbalance in the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - can lead to a variety of health issues. When these aggravated doshas spread through the body's circulatory channels alongside the first tissue responsible for nourishment (rasa dhatu), they displace the digestive fire (jatharagni) from its optimal location. As the doshas and jatharagni combine their heat, the body's temperature rises, further exacerbating the imbalance. If these channels become obstructed, the excess heat generated permeates the entire body, leading to a condition known as jwara or fever. This deep understanding of the interplay between bodily systems and environmental factors offers insight into holistic approaches for restoring balance and maintaining overall well-being."
1352,A person suffering from taruna jwara (the initial stage of jwara) does not sweat because of the obstruction of the channels of circulation and the displacement of agni. [132-133],"In the ancient medical text, Charaka Samhita, the concept of taruna jwara, or the initial stage of fever, is explained with great detail. One such explanation describes the obstruction of the circulatory channels and the displacement of agni (digestive fire) as the cause for the absence of sweat in an individual suffering from taruna jwara. This blockage and displacement lead to a disturbance in the body's natural processes, creating an imbalance that manifests as fever. The intricate understanding of the human body and its workings that is demonstrated in this text is truly remarkable, providing valuable insights into the Ayurvedic approach to health and healing."
1353,"The ama jwara (first stage of jwara) presents with the following clinical features –   Anorexia, indigestion, heaviness in the stomach Feeling of heaviness and accumulation of impurities in cardiac region, drowsiness and laziness Continuous, fever with acute onset. Non-elimination of the dosha along with mala or waste products Excess salivation, nausea, loss of appetite, and tastelessness in the mouth Rigidity, numbness and heaviness of the body Excessive urination Improper formation of stool Absence of muscle emaciation [133-136]","The ama jwara, the initial stage of fever in Ayurvedic medicine, is characterized by a set of distinct clinical features that help in its early identification and treatment. This stage presents with anorexia, indigestion, and heaviness in the stomach, along with a feeling of accumulation of impurities in the cardiac region. Accompanying symptoms include drowsiness, laziness, and continuous fever with acute onset. The non-elimination of dosha or bodily humors, along with mala or waste products, is also observed during this stage. Other symptoms such as excess salivation, nausea, loss of appetite, and tastelessness in the mouth are common. Additionally, rigidity, numbness, and heaviness of the body, excessive urination, improper formation of stool, and absence of muscle emaciation are also indicative of ama jwara [133-136].

It is characterized by a number of notable features that are crucial to its identification. A significant increase in body temperature, specifically high-grade fever, is one of the primary symptoms. Additionally, sufferers experience excessive thirst and delirium, causing them to feel disoriented and confused. Dyspnea, or difficulty breathing, is another distressing symptom, often accompanied by giddiness or a sensation of dizziness. Lastly, an excess evacuation of wastes is also observed during this stage. Understanding these features can aid in the effective management and treatment of fever in Ayurvedic medicine."
1355,"Restoration of hunger, debility, lightness in the body, reduced fever, elimination of the dosha along with the waste products from the body – are all the clinical features of nirama jwara (condition when the patient’s body becomes free from the ama). These features generally appear on the 8th day. [137-138]","The restoration of hunger, alleviation of weakness, and the return of lightness in the body are all signs that the patient is recovering from their ailment. These symptoms, along with the reduction of fever and the elimination of excess dosha and waste products from the body, indicate that the individual has achieved a state of nirama jwara. According to Ayurvedic texts, these positive clinical features typically become apparent on the eighth day of treatment, signaling that the body is becoming freed from the harmful effects of ama."
1356,"The patient, in the state of nava jwara (first stage fever) should avoid certain things as – daytime sleep, bath, massage, heavy to digest food, sexual intercourse, anger, direct exposure to wind, exercise, and kashaya (astringent foods). [138-139]","In the early stages of fever, known as nava jwara in ancient Sanskrit texts, it is crucial to take specific measures to aid recovery. The sage Charaka, a renowned ancient Indian physician, advised against several activities that may hinder the healing process. These include daytime sleeping, taking baths, and undergoing massages. Additionally, patients should avoid consuming heavy, hard-to-digest foods, engaging in sexual intercourse, or succumbing to anger. Exposure to direct wind and strenuous exercise should also be avoided, as should the consumption of astringent foods, known as kashaya. By following this advice, individuals in the nava jwara state can create an optimal environment for healing and restore their health more efficiently."
1357,"Langhana or fasting is prescribed in the initial stage of jwara except those caused by kshaya (consumption), vata dominant jwara, fear, anger, passion, grief and physical exertion.[139-140]","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, fasting or Langhana is considered a beneficial practice during the onset of jwara or fever, with certain exceptions. It is recommended as a treatment for fevers that are not caused by consumption (kshaya), vata dominance, fear, anger, passion, grief, or excessive physical exertion. By abstaining from food intake, the body can focus its energy on fighting off the fever and promoting healing, providing relief from the symptoms of jwara while supporting overall health and well-being."
1358,"Langhana reduces the aggravated dosha and stimulates the agni, as a result of which jwara subsides and the body becomes light and the person’s appetite is restored. Langhana should be performed to the extent that it does not hamper the vitality or strength of the individual. The aim of all these measures is to regain the health which also depends on the physical, mental and spiritual strength. [140-142]","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, the concept of Langhana holds great significance. This therapeutic measure is used to reduce the excess dosha in the body and stimulate the digestive fire or agni. As a result, feverish symptoms, known as jwara, are alleviated and the body feels light. Moreover, one's appetite is restored, leading to improved health. However, it is crucial that Langhana treatments are administered with care, ensuring they do not weaken the individual's vitality or strength. The ultimate goal of these measures is to restore health, which is closely linked with physical, mental, and spiritual well-being."
1359,"Langhana (fasting), swedana (fomentation), kala (waiting period of eight days), yavagu (medicated gruels) and tikta rasa drugs (drugs having bitter taste) and all digestive enhancers of avipakva dosha (untransformed) are prescribed in the taruna jwara (the initial stage of jwara).[142]","In the early stages of fever, known as taruna jwara, specific treatments are recommended to manage this initial phase. These include langhana, or fasting, which helps to reduce the overall burden on the body. Swedana, or fomentation, is also prescribed to promote sweating and eliminate toxins. During this time, it's essential to allow for a kala, a waiting period of eight days, to observe the progression of the fever. Medicated gruels, known as yavagu, are introduced during this stage to provide necessary nutrients while also targeting the disease. Additionally, drugs with a bitter taste (tikta rasa) and those that aid digestion by transforming untransformed dosha (avipakva) are crucial in managing taruna jwara. Together, these treatments offer a comprehensive approach to addressing the initial stage of fever, as outlined in traditional Sanskrit texts."
1360,"If the patient of jwara feels thirsty, he should be given : Hot water to drink if the jwara caused by aggravation of vata and kapha; If the jwara is pitta dominant or if it occurs as a result of intake of alcohol, water boiled with bitter drugs and then cooled, is given. Both of these are dipana, (digestive stimulant), pachana (enhancing digestion), and jwaraghna (alleviators of jwara). They help in cleansing the channels of circulation and promote strength, appetite, sweating and auspiciousness. [143-145]","In the ancient medical text of Ayurveda, specific guidelines are provided for managing jwara (fever) based on the dominant dosha involved. If the fever is a result of an aggravation of vata and kapha, hot water is recommended as a remedy to quench the patient's thirst. On the other hand, if the fever is pitta-dominant or is caused by alcohol consumption, water boiled with bitter drugs and then cooled should be given. These simple yet effective treatments serve multiple purposes: they act as dipana and pachana, stimulating digestion, and jwaraghna, alleviating fever. Moreover, they help cleanse the body's circulatory channels, boost strength, increase appetite, induce sweating, and ultimately promote overall health and well-being."
1361,"Patient should be given water cooled after boiling it with musta, parpataka, ushira, chandana, udichya and nagara for the alleviation of thirst and jwara. [145]","In Ayurvedic medicine, a specific concoction of herbs is recommended to soothe symptoms of thirst and fever, also known as jwara. The treatment involves boiling water with musta, parpataka, ushira, chandana, udichya, and nagara. After boiling, the water should be cooled before giving it to the patient. This traditional remedy has been passed down through generations, emphasizing the importance of natural ingredients in promoting health and well-being."
1362,"If the jwara is predominantly caused by vitiated kapha dosha, located in the amashaya (stomach) and is in a stage of utklesha (in a stage of being on the verge of coming out of its place), then it should be eliminated by the administration of emetics.  Note: The status of kapha should be ascertained clearly before the administration of drug and emetics should be given only to those patients who are found suitable for emesis.[147]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, it is recommended that if a fever, or jwara, is predominantly caused by the imbalance of kapha dosha and has reached a stage of utklesha in the amashaya, then emetics should be administered to eliminate the excess dosha. However, it is crucial to accurately determine the state of kapha before prescribing any medication, and emesis should only be performed on patients who are deemed suitable candidates for this treatment. This traditional approach to healing highlights the importance of individualized care and close observation in Ayurvedic practice."
1363,"If vamana (emesis) is administered to a jwara patient in whom the dosha have not attained the stage of utklesha (verge of coming out), then they may cause acute form of heart disease, dyspnea, anaha (obstruction to the movement of flatus and feces) and illusion. Attempting to take out the anupasthita dosha (unprepared to be eliminated) from the body of a person bring complications for the person and is just like attempting to take out juice from a raw fruit which creates complications (destroys the fruit).  [147-149]","The administration of vamana, or therapeutic emesis, to a jwara patient whose doshas have not yet reached the stage of utklesha must be approached with caution. If performed prematurely, it can lead to severe complications, including heart disease and dyspnea. Additionally, the unprepared doshas may cause obstructions in the movement of feces and flatus, leading to further discomfort and distress. These attempts are likened to extracting juice from a raw fruit, causing unnecessary damage and destruction to the body. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the doshas have reached the appropriate stage before administering vamana to avoid any potential harm or complications to the patient. [AI generated content]"
1364,"The patient after being given emesis and kept on fasting should be administered yavagu (a gruel preparation) prepared by boiling with the drugs mentioned further, in appropriate time. Before administering yavagu, the patient should be given manda (extremely thin gruel). This should be continued by the wise for either six days or till the jwara becomes mild. As the addition of samidha (fuel) accelerates the fire, similarly the digestive fire also becomes stimulated by the consumption of gruels. These gruels are inherently light for digestion and they further stimulate the agni due to the addition of drugs to it.  ","The administration of emesis followed by fasting is a common treatment strategy in traditional medicine. After this, a thin gruel known as manda is given to the patient. Following this, a yavagu, a gruel prepared by boiling with specified drugs, is administered at appropriate intervals. This regimen, recommended by ancient scholars, should be continued for either six days or until the fever subsides. The consumption of these light and easily digestible gruels not only provides necessary nourishment but also stokes the digestive fire, similar to how fuel accelerates a fire. The addition of drugs to the gruel further enhances its ability to stimulate the agni, making it an effective treatment for various ailments."
1365,"These help in anulomana (elimination through the downward movement) of flatus, urine, feces and doshas. Being liquid and hot they also cause sweating. Being watery in nature they also alleviate thirst. Due to their nourishing property as a diet, they sustain the prana (vitality) and cause lightness of the body because of their laxative property. They bring down the jwara and are also wholesome for the jwara patients.  In view of above, a jwara patient should in the beginning be administered with different types of peya (thin gruels). [149-153]","The administration of liquid and hot gruels, known as peya, plays a crucial role in managing various bodily functions, according to Ayurvedic texts. These thin gruels aid in the elimination of intestinal gas, urine, and feces by facilitating their downward movement. Additionally, they promote sweating due to their warm and moist properties. These gruels also help quench thirst and provide essential nourishment, thereby supporting the body's vitality and causing a feeling of lightness. Furthermore, peya can help reduce feverish symptoms, making it particularly beneficial for jwara patients. Thus, Ayurvedic practitioners recommend the use of different types of thin gruels as an initial course of treatment for individuals suffering from jwara."
1366,"However, these gruels are contraindicated in the fevers caused by intake of alcohol, in alcoholism, for persons addicted to alcohol, in summer seasons, when there is predominance of pitta and kapha and in urdhwaga rakta–pitta (a disease characterized by bleeding from the different upper channels of the body).[154]","In the context of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, there are certain restrictions to consider when it comes to consuming gruels made from specific grains. These exclusions include fevers resulting from alcohol consumption or alcoholism, as well as those who are habitually dependent on this substance. The heat of summer and an imbalance in the pitta and kapha doshas also present contraindications for consuming these gruels. Additionally, individuals suffering from urdhwaga rakta-pitta, a condition characterized by bleeding from upper channels of the body, should avoid them as well. Therefore, it is essential to consult with a knowledgeable practitioner before incorporating any new dietary practices based on ancient Ayurvedic texts."
1367,"In cases where yavagu administration is prohibited, the physician should administer in the beginning tarpana (nutritional diet) prepared from laja saktu (powder of roasted grains) mixed with honey, sugar and fruit juices, which have jwara alleviating properties.[155]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, there are certain situations where the administration of a therapeutic substance called yavagu is contraindicated. In these cases, the practitioner must look to alternative methods to promote healing and alleviate symptoms. According to ancient Sanskrit texts, one such method involves the use of a specially prepared nutritional diet known as tarpana. This nourishing mixture is made from laja saktu, or powdered roasted grains, combined with honey, sugar, and fruit juices, all of which are believed to have properties that can help reduce fever and promote overall well-being. By carefully following these time-honored traditions, Ayurvedic practitioners continue to offer their patients a holistic approach to health and healing."
1368,"Depending upon the habituation (satmya) and the strength of the patient, after digestion of the tarpana, patient is administered thin soup of mudga (green gram) or meat of wild animals. ","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, the concept of habituation and a patient's strength play a crucial role in their recovery process. After undergoing the therapeutic procedure of Tarpana, where medicated substances are filled into the eyes or other parts of the body, the patient is given light sustenance. This typically takes the form of a thin soup, either made from green gram (mudga) for vegetarian patients or meat from wild animals for those who can consume it. The choice of diet reflects Ayurveda' considerations for individual preferences and constitution while supporting the healing journey."
1369,"During food time, the patient’s teeth should be cleaned with the twig of plants, which should be such that their taste can counteract the taste of the patient’s mouth and is relishing to the patient. Such kind of cleaning of teeth makes the patient feel freshness in his mouth, develops appetite for food and drinks and becomes capable of appreciating the taste of food to be taken. The mouth should be cleaned several times with water after cleaning with twigs. Thereafter the patient should be given mastu (thin butter milk), sugarcane juice, alcoholic drinks etc. with suitable and appropriate diet.[156-159]","The importance of proper oral hygiene is highlighted in this ancient Sanskrit text, advocating for the use of plant twigs to clean the teeth during meal times. This practice not only freshens the mouth but also stimulates the patient's appetite and enhances their ability to savor the flavors of their food. After rinsing several times with water, the patient is then offered various liquids such as thin buttermilk, sugarcane juice, and alcoholic beverages along with a suitable diet. This thoughtful regimen suggests an early understanding of the connection between oral health and overall well-being."
1370,"The jwara patient, after six days and having been given light diet to eat, should be administered decoctions, which are either pachana (stimulant of digestion) or shamana (alleviator of doshas). [160-161]","In the management of jwara, or fever, in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, great importance is placed on the administration of specific decoctions at crucial junctures of treatment. After six rigorous days of illness, a patient who has been maintained on a light diet to conserve energy is prepared for the next stage of recovery. At this time, the attending physician may choose to administer decoctions that serve one of two purposes: either as a pachana or a shamana. A pachana acts as a stimulant of digestion, helping the patient's metabolism recover and regain strength. Meanwhile, a shamana is a gentle alleviator of doshas, working to restore balance in the body and mind without causing undue stress or strain. These time-tested methods continue to provide valuable guidance for practitioners seeking to treat jwara patients effectively and kindly, according to Ayurvedic principles."
1371,"If, decoctions of astringent drugs are administered to the patient in taruna jwara (first stage of jwara) stage, then the doshas do not undergo paka (digested) and get adhered due to stickiness. This leads to the onset of vishama jwara (irregular fevers). The term kashaya has two meanings i.e. the decoction prepared by boiling the drugs and astringent taste. In the first stage of jwara (taruna jwara), the astringent tasted drugs are prohibited. [161-163]","The administration of astringent drug decoctions in the initial stage of fever, known as taruna jwara, is to be avoided. This is because, instead of getting digested and eliminating the doshas, they become stuck and adhered, leading to further complications. In this stage, it is crucial to understand that the term 'kashaya' refers not only to the astringent-tasting drugs but also to the decoction prepared by boiling them. Consuming such astringent drugs or decoctions during taruna jwara can result in the onset of irregular fevers, or vishama jwara, making the recovery process more challenging."
1372,"The patient should be given light diet along with yusha (soup) prepared from vegetables and pulses and rasa (soup) of the meat of animals inhabiting arid regions, for the alleviation of jwara, up to the tenth day. Amla (sour) things may or may not be added to these yusha. [163-164]","In the treatment of fever, or jwara, it is recommended that patients partake in a specialized diet for the first ten days. This regimen should include light foods and two types of soups: yusha made from vegetables and pulses, and rasa derived from animals that inhabit arid regions. The inclusion of sour components, such as amla, in these soups is optional. These dietary measures, along with appropriate medical care, can aid in the alleviation of fever symptoms."
1373,"Thereafter, in case of less aggravation of kapha dosha and excess aggravation of vata and pitta dosha, and in whom the dosha have reached the pakva stage (having no ama ansha), ghee should be given to the patients. It is like amrita (nectar) for them. Ghee should not be given to jwara patient even after the tenth day, if the kapha dosha still predominates and if the signs and symptoms of well accomplished langhana have not appeared. In such case kashaya should be administered to the patient till the body becomes light. Till the features of langhana appear in the body, the patient should be given light to digest food along with the meat soup of wild animals and birds. This destroys the strength of the doshas and promotes the strength of the body. [164-167]","In managing certain health conditions, where there is a predominance of aggravated vata and pitta dosha, along with a less aggressive state of kapha dosha, the introduction of ghee to the patient's diet is recommended. At this stage, ghee serves as a life-giving elixir, providing nourishment and assisting in the pacification of the imbalanced doshas. However, it is important to note that ghee should not be administered to a jwara patient even after the tenth day if kapha dosha remains dominant and the signs of successful langhana (a therapeutic process aimed at reducing excess doshas) are yet to appear. During this period, kashaya (a herbal decoction) should be given to the patient until their body becomes lighter and exhibits the features of well-executed langhana. A diet consisting of light and easily digestible food along with meat soup derived from wild animals and birds is suggested to diminish the doshas' strength while simultaneously enhancing the body's resilience. (Charaka Samhita, 164-167)"
1374,"A patient with the following conditions should be given milk in nirama stage in the body –   When the patient has excessive burning sensation and thirst If vata and pitta dosha predominate the patient is suffering from jwara If the dosha are either baddha (static), or prachyuta (slightly dislodged). [167]","In the nirama stage of the body, milk is recommended as a beneficial drink for patients with specific symptoms, according to Ayurvedic teachings. If a patient is experiencing intense heat and unquenchable thirst, milk can provide necessary hydration and coolness. Moreover, it is advised for individuals in which vata and pitta doshas are predominant, leading to a feverish state known as jwara. This soothing beverage is also considered suitable for patients with either baddha (static) or prachyuta (slightly dislodged) doshas, offering potential relief and balance to the body during recovery."
1375,"If the jwara does not subside by the therapies described before, then virechana (purgation) should be given for its alleviation provided, the patient is neither emaciated, weak, depleted of muscle tissue nor has reduced digestive power. [168-169]","In instances where the fever, or jwara, continues to persist despite initial treatments, Ayurvedic practitioners recommend turning to virechana, or controlled purgation, as a means of relief. This method should only be considered if certain conditions are met: the patient must not be overly thin, weak, or lacking in muscle mass, and their digestive abilities must remain strong and robust. By ensuring these factors align, the therapeutic process can proceed with greater confidence in its potential for success and reduced risk of further complications (Charaka Samhita, translation by Dr. Priya Tewari, 168-169)."
1376,"Neither vamana (emesis) nor virechana (purgation) is useful for patients emaciated by fever. It is thus desirable to remove their malas by the administration of milk or niruha (ununctuous type of medicated enema prepared by decoctions etc.)  Niruha basti administered when the dosha are in paripakva stage immediately promotes the strength and the power of digestion, alleviates fever and causes happiness and brings relish for food. Purgation (stransana) eliminates kapha or kapha pitta dosha from the pittashaya (lower portion of the stomach and small intestine). Basti eliminates all the three dosha lodged in the pakwashaya.[169-170]","In the context of managing feverish patients who are severely weakened, traditional Ayurvedic texts offer valuable insights. According to Sanskrit verses translated, neither emesis nor purgation is recommended in such cases. Instead, it is advised to cleanse their bodies through gentle means such as milk or a special type of enema called niruha basti. This enema, prepared by decoctions, has the unique ability to eliminate all three doshas from the body and immediately strengthens the patient, improving digestion, alleviating fever, and restoring their appetite. On the other hand, purgation is recommended only for eliminating kapha or kapha-pitta dosha in the lower part of the stomach and small intestine. These ancient Ayurvedic practices continue to offer a holistic approach to healing and managing various health conditions even today."
1377,"In chronic types of fever (jirna jwara) anuvasana type of basti (medicated enema with oils) should be given in the following conditions –  When kapha and pitta are alleviated When there is strong power of digestion When there is ununctuousness (rukshata) and bandhatwa (obstruction, compactness) in the feces. [172-173]","In the management of chronic fever, also known as jirna jwara, the ancient medical text of Ayurveda, the Charaka Samhita, offers specific guidance on the use of medicated enemas called anuvasana basti. According to the text, anuvasana basti, which is characterized by the use of oils, is recommended when both kapha and pitta doshas have been alleviated. This therapy is also advised when there is a strong power of digestion present, as well as in cases where there is unctuousness (rukshata) and compactness (bandhatwa) found within the feces. These conditions suggest that anuvasana basti can help to further reduce any remaining imbalances and promote overall health and well-being."
1378,"Murdha virechana should be done in patients suffering from chronic type of fevers who have heaviness and pain in head, impaired sensoria. This develops relish for food and also the objects. [173-174]","According to ancient Sanskrit texts, Murdha virechana, a therapeutic procedure that involves the evacuation of toxins from the top of the head, is recommended for individuals suffering from chronic fevers. This therapy is specifically indicated for those experiencing heaviness and pain in the head, as well as impaired sensory perception. Interestingly, Murdha virechana not only helps alleviate these symptoms but also reportedly rekindles the patient's appetite and interest in their surroundings, contributing to their overall well-being and recovery. This ancient wisdom offers a unique perspective on holistic healthcare, highlighting the importance of detoxification and mental stimulation in disease management."
1379,"Abhyanga (massage), pradeha (unguentum), parisheka (sprinkling of water), and avagahana (bathing) should be done in patients of jirna jwara (chronic fevers) considering the types of jwara with their hot and cold types. By these measures the bahirmargagata (located in the external tissues) jwara gets alleviated instantaneously. There is a feeling of ease in the body along with the promotion of strength and complexion. Jirna jwara (chronic stage) also gets alleviated by the administration of dhupana (fumigation) and anjana (collyrium).  Jwara located in skin and of exogenous nature or types can be treated with same. [174-177]","The ancient medical science of Ayurveda offers a unique approach to managing chronic fevers, known as jirna jwara. The practices of Abhyanga, Pradeha, Parsheka, and Avagahana are recommended, taking into account the specific hot and cold types of the fever. These measures, when applied to the external tissues, provide instant relief from the symptoms and bring a sense of comfort and strength to the body. Furthermore, Dhupana and Anjana treatments can also help alleviate chronic fevers, as well as skin-based and exogenous fevers. This comprehensive approach offers a holistic solution to managing these persistent ailments, as outlined in verses 174-177 of the Ayurvedic text."
1380,"Proper line of treatment for the alleviation of jwara has been described above, the ingredients used for therapies in accordance to the above stated line of treatment has been described further. For this purpose, rakta shali, shashtika type of purana (preserved for over an year) rice are the best and should be given in the form of yavagu (gruel), odana (boiled rice), laja (fried paddy) as these mitigate jwara of the patient. [177-179]","The appropriate treatment for alleviating fever, or jwara, has been detailed in the previous discussion. To further elaborate, the most excellent ingredients for carrying out these therapies are rakta shali rice and shashtika purana rice, which has been preserved for over a year. These components should be administered to the patient in the form of yavagu (gruel), odana (boiled rice), or laja (fried paddy). The use of these remedies is sure to help mitigate the severity of jwara, providing relief to the afflicted individual."
1381,"The peya prepared with laja (fried paddy) and boiled with pippali and nagara is light to digest and should be given to the patient in the beginning of the jwara when the digestive power is reduced. However, it should be ascertained before administration that the patient is desirous for food before administration. If there is movement of bowel and the patient is desirous of sour things, then the peya described above should be made sour by adding dadima and should be given along with nagara. ","In the early stages of fever, when the digestive capabilities of a patient are diminished, it is recommended to offer them a light and easily digestible peya (thin gruel). This particular peya is prepared by boiling laja (fried paddy) with pippali (long pepper) and nagara (a type of spice), forming a concoction that supports the patient's delicate condition. However, it's essential to ensure the patient feels hungry and displays a readiness for food before administering this peya. In case the patient experiences bowel movements and expresses a preference for sour flavors, the peya should be adjusted accordingly by adding dadima (tamarind) to give it a sour taste, which should then be served with nagara."
1382,"The above mentioned peya should be cooled and added with honey before administration in paittika type of patient. A patient suffering from shoola (pain) in the parshva (flanks), basti (urinary bladder) and shira (head) regions should be given peya prepared from red variety of shali rice and boiled with shvadashtra and kantakari as this alleviates jwara. A person suffering from jwaratisara (fever associated with diarrhea) should be given peya which is sour and is boiled with prishniparni, bala, bilva, nagara, utpala and dhanyaka. Patients suffering from jwara associated with kasa (bronchitis), shwasa (difficulty in breathing) and hikka (hiccups) should be given yavagu prepared by boiling with the group of drugs belonging to vidarigandhadi gana, which acts as a stimulant of digestion and promotes sweating. Peya prepared of yava (barley) boiled with pippali and amalaki should be given to a patient suffering from jwara associated with koshthabaddhata(constipation). ","In the treatment of Paittika patients suffering from pain in the flanks, urinary bladder, and head, it is recommended to administer a cooled down peya made from red shali rice, boiled with shvadashtra and kantakari. This mixture acts as an effective remedy for fever. In cases where fever is accompanied by diarrhea, a sour peya prepared with prishniparni, bala, bilva, nagara, utpala and dhanyaka is advised. For patients experiencing fever along with bronchitis, difficulty in breathing, and hiccups, yavagu made from boiling vidarigandhadi gana group of drugs is suggested to promote sweating and improve digestion. Lastly, a peya made by boiling barley with pippali and amalaki is recommended for patients suffering from fever with constipation."
1383,"It causes anulomana (downward movement) of dosha. This peya mixed with ghee should be taken by the patient suffering from jwara associated with constipation. The peya prepared by boiling with mridvika, pippali mula, chavya, amalaka and nagara should be taken by the patient suffering from jwara associated with constipation and pain. ","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, a specific concoction known as ""peya"" is recommended for individuals suffering from fever (jwara) accompanied by constipation and pain. This peya is prepared through a meticulous process involving the boiling of mridvika, pippali mula (pippali root), chavya, amalaka (Indian gooseberry), and nagara. According to Ayurvedic principles, the consumption of this concoction, when mixed with ghee, aids in the downward movement (anulomana) of dosha or bodily humors, providing relief from constipation. This traditional remedy offers an alternative approach to modern medicine for managing such health conditions."
1384,"Peya boiled with bala, vrikshamla, kolamla, kalashi (simha pucchi), dhavani (kantakari) and bilva should be given to a patient suffering from jwara associated with sawing pain. (cutting pain). Peya prepared by boiling with nagara and amalaka fried with ghee and mixed with sugar is jwaraghna (alleviates jwara). It should be given to a patient suffering from asweda (absence of sweating), anidra (sleeplessness) and trishna (morbid thirst).

The verse advocates for a carefully curated peya, or therapeutic drink, prepared by boiling bala, vrikshamla, kolamla, kantakari (also known as dhavani), bilva, and simha pucchi (or kalashi) in water. For patients experiencing anhidrosis, insomnia, and intense thirst accompanying fever, another peya is recommended, this time infused with the soothing properties of nagara and amalaka, which are fried in ghee and sweetened with sugar to create a concoction that alleviates jwara. These age-old remedies continue to hold relevance in contemporary healthcare conversations, highlighting Ayurveda's enduring significance as a holistic medical system."
1385,"Yusha is wholesome for some patients of jwara. This yusha may be prepared from mudga, masura, chanaka, kulattha and makushtha.[188-189]","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, Yusha has been identified as a beneficial treatment for certain jwara (fever) patients. This therapeutic concoction can be prepared using a variety of ingredients, including mudga (green gram), masura (lentil), chanaka (split pea), kulattha (horse gram), and makushtha (black gram). Each of these components plays a crucial role in creating the wholesome mixture that helps alleviate the symptoms of fever in specific patients, making Yusha a highly regarded remedy in traditional Ayurvedic practice. [188-189]"
1386,"The leaves and fruits of patola, kulaka (karvellaka), papachelika (patha), karkotaka, kathilla (red variety of punarnava) shakas are useful in the patients of jwara. [189-190]","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, the healing properties of certain plants have been revered for centuries. According to a translated Sanskrit verse from an ancient text, the leaves and fruits of patola, kulaka (also known as karvellaka), papachelika (or patha), karkotaka, and kathilla (the red variety of punarnava) are cited as beneficial for patients suffering from jwara (fever). These potent plant-based remedies offer a glimpse into the rich and enduring tradition of Ayurveda, where nature's pharmacy holds the key to restoring balance and health within the body."
1387,"The soup prepared from lava, kapinjala (white variety of tittiri), ena (krishna sara), chakora, upachakraka (a variety of chakora), kuranga, kala puccha (a type of harina), harina (coppery coloured dear), priashata (spotted deer) and shasha (rabbit) are alleviators of jwara and hence should be given to the patients of jwara for whom meat is wholesome. These meat soups may be made slightly sour or taken as such. The wise physician should administer these soups at appropriate time.  Some physicians do not advise the meat soups of animals such as kukkuta, mayura, tittiri, krauncha and vartaka as they are heavy to digest and hot potency. In jwara if vayu gets aggravated because of langhana, then the physician acquainted with the signs of the doshas should give the meat soup of these animals also at apropriate time.[190-194]","In the ancient Indian medical text, Soup Preparations using various meats are recommended for managing jwara or fever. Notably, soups from lava, kapinjala, ena, chakora, upachakraka, kuranga, kalapuccha, harina, and priyashata are highlighted as beneficial in reducing jwara's intensity. These meat soups can be consumed plain or with a touch of sourness to enhance their therapeutic value. The right timing of these soups is crucial, advises the text, and it should be administered by experienced physicians. However, some soups such as those made from kukkuta, mayura, tittiri, krauncha, and vartaka are discouraged due to their heavy and heat-producing qualities. Nonetheless, in cases where jwara is accompanied by aggravated vayu (air), the text suggests that these otherwise avoided meat soups could be beneficial if administered at appropriate times."
1388,Hot water should be given to drink to a thirsty person. Depending upon the doshas involved and the strength of the patient madya (wines) may be given to those patients for whom it is wholesome. [194-195],"In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, there are time-tested recommendations for soothing a parched throat and promoting well-being. According to Charaka Samhita, a foundational text, offering hot water to someone suffering from thirst is advised. Furthermore, for certain patients possessing specific dosha balances and adequate strength, madya (wines) may be administered, provided it is beneficial to their health. These ancient remedies, when applied skillfully and with a proper understanding of individual constitutions, can potentially offer relief and support the healing process."
1389,"Food ingredients, which are heavy to digest, hot in potency, with unctuous property, sweet and astringent taste should preferably be avoided in a patient suffering from nava jwara (the patient of first stage of jwara) in order to facilitate the paka of the doshas.  So, the diet and drinks, which are wholesome to the patient of jwara have been described here. [195-196]","In the context of managing a patient with nava jwara, or the first stage of fever, it is advised to avoid certain food ingredients in order to facilitate the paka, or digestion, of doshas. These ingredients are heavy to digest, hot in potency, unctuous in property, and have sweet and astringent tastes. Such foods can exacerbate the condition and hinder the recovery process. Instead, it is recommended that the patient consume wholesome food and drinks that support their health and aid in their recovery. The appropriate dietary choices for a jwara patient are described in detail, with an emphasis on ingredients that are easy to digest, cool in potency, and have light, dry properties. [195-196]"
1390,"Now, we will describe the kashayas (decoctions), which alleviate jwara. These are as follows:  Musta and parpataka can be taken either in the form of decoction (pakya) or shita kashaya (soaking the drugs for overnight period in water and then filtering the content and using the filtrate). Parpataka decoction may be given to the patient along with nagara and duralabha. The decoction made from kirata tikta, musta, guduchi and vishva bheshaja. The decoction of patha and ushira along with udichya. The above mentioned, decoctions which are used for the alleviation of jwara are jwaraghna. They stimulate the power of digestion, help in the pachana (metabolic transformation) of the doshas; alleviate thirst, anorexia and cure mukha vairasya (bad taste of the mouth).

These can be prepared using Musta and Parpataka, either as a hot decoction or by soaking the drugs overnight and then filtering the content for use. Parpataka decoction can be given to the patient along with Nagara and Duralabha. Another kashaya can be made from Kirata Tikta, Musta, Guduchi, and Vishva Bheshaja. A third option includes the decoction of Patha and Ushira combined with Udichya. These jwaraghna decoctions stimulate digestion, aid in the metabolic transformation of the doshas, alleviate thirst, appetite loss, and cure bad taste in the mouth, making them essential tools in Ayurvedic fever management."

1393,"The decoction of either jati, amalaka and musta or that of dhanavayavasakam along with guda (jaggery) should be given to the patient suffering from jwara where the doshas are in vibaddha state (adhered to dhatus).

This ancient Sanskrit verse underscores the importance of holistic approaches to healthcare, emphasizing the power of nature's pharmacy in restoring balance and health to the human body."
1395," Shati, pushkaramula, vyaghri, shringi, duralabha, guduchi, nagara, patha, kirata, katurohini - all together are called by the name of shatyadi varga.

1398,"If in a person of ununctuous disposition, jwara doesn’t get cured by the use of decoctions, emesis, fasting and by light diet, then jwara in such a person should be cured by the use of medicated ghrita (ghee). Jwara is manifested by ununctuous state of tejasa in such a person and a patient suffering from jwara further develops ununctuousness due to the action of this tejasa (pitta). The vata gets aggravated due to the action of this tejasa and it can be corrected by the use of some unctuous material like ghrita.

The unctuous state of tejasa in such a person can lead to an increase in the unctuousness associated with pitta, which in turn aggravates vata. By using an unctuous material like ghrita, the balance of these doshas can be restored and the fever can be alleviated."

1426,"He should take bath in rivers, ponds, ponds having lotus plant and lakes having clean water. This bath alleviates burning sensation, morbid thirst, glāni and jwara. ","In the pursuit of maintaining a healthy body and mind, the ancient Sanskrit text emphasizes the importance of taking a daily bath in natural bodies of water. It is suggested that one should seek out rivers, ponds adorned with lotus plants, and clear lakes to cleanse themselves. This practice is believed to not only provide physical benefits such as relief from burning sensations and excessive thirst but also alleviate glāni (mental or emotional exhaustion) and jwara (fever). By immersing oneself in nature's bounty, one can experience a sense of rejuvenation and healing that goes beyond mere physical cleansing."
1427,"Such patient should also be comforted with the touch of ladies smeared with sandalwood paste, wearing desirable jewels and pearls; which are affectionate and skilled with polite manners.  ","In the delicate process of caring for a patient, it is often recommended to incorporate comforting measures that engage multiple senses. According to ancient Sanskrit texts, one such method involves the soothing touch of women who have been anointed with sandalwood paste. These caregivers are adorned with desirable jewels and pearls, their polished appearances reflecting the grace and elegance of their mannerisms. Their affections are genuine, and their skills in interacting politely create a nurturing environment that promotes healing and wellbeing. This ancient practice highlights the importance of holistic care, recognizing that comfort and compassion play crucial roles in the recovery process."
1428,"Diet and drinks which are cold, cooling gardens, cold wind and cold rays of the moon; alleviate jwara with burning sensation. [260-266]","In the ancient wisdom of Sanskrit texts, a surprising remedy is revealed for fever accompanied by burning sensation. Recommended are diet and drinks that have a cooling effect, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, cool water, and herbal teas. Additionally, the soothing comfort of a shaded garden can provide relief, as well as the gentle touch of a cool breeze. Interestingly, even the soft glow of moonlight is suggested to alleviate discomfort caused by fever. These natural methods offer an alternative approach to modern medicine, rooted in centuries-old knowledge."
1429,Thirteen varities of sweda procedures have been described in the Swedadhyaya of Sutra Sthana. A physician who is well versed with the proper duration of sweda as suitable to the season and person should administer them for the treatment of shīta jwara.,"In the ancient text of Ayurveda, the Swutra Sthana's Swedadhyaya section provides a comprehensive description of thirteen varieties of sweda procedures. These therapeutic sweating techniques are essential in treating various health conditions, including shīta jwara or shivering fever. A skilled physician with a deep understanding of these methods must consider the appropriate duration of sweda based on the individual's constitution and the season to effectively administer these treatments for optimal patient care."
1430, Sleeping on a bed and covering oneself with clothes in the kuthi sweda (fomentation technique by keeping the patient in a cottage) immediately alleviates sheeta. ,"In the ancient Indian practice of Kuthi Sweda, a fomentation technique that involves enclosing the patient in a specially designed cottage, there is a notable observation: the simple act of lying down on a bed and covering oneself with clothes brings immediate relief from sheeta, or coolness. This fascinating discovery showcases the intricate understanding of the human body and its responses to external stimuli that is at the core of traditional Indian healing practices. The Kuthi Sweda methodology offers a unique and holistic approach to well-being, rooted in time-tested wisdom and practices that continue to captivate modern researchers and practitioners alike."
1431,"Similarly, the strong fumigation by aguru also alleviates shīta. Sheeta jwara is also cured by the embrace of passionate ladies who are beautiful, have plump body and are young, due to their youthful heat.  ","In ancient Indian texts, there are various remedies recommended for different ailments, one of them being the use of aguru for alleviating shīta jwara or chills and shivering. The potent aroma of aguru is believed to create warmth in the body, providing relief from such symptoms. Interestingly, another unique remedy mentioned for sheeta jwara is the embrace of beautiful young women with plump bodies, who are passionate about their affections. The heat generated by their youthful energy is said to cure the ailment, demonstrating the holistic approach of ancient Indian medicine towards health and healing."
1432,"Different types of diet and drinks which cause fomentation and alleviate vata and kapha, instantaneously alleviate sheeta jwara. These should be administered keeping in view of the samsarga (combination of two doshas) and the bala of each dosha. [268-271]","In Ayurvedic medicine, the type of diet and drinks consumed can have a significant impact on an individual's health, particularly in relation to the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha. According to Charaka Samhita, consuming foods and beverages that cause fomentation (generating internal heat) can help alleviate the combined effect of vata and kapha, as well as provide instant relief from sheeta jwara or ""cold fever."" However, it is crucial to consider the samsarga (combination of two doshas) and the bala (strength) of each dosha before administering these remedies. Ayurvedic practitioners must take a holistic approach to treatment, carefully evaluating each patient's unique constitution and condition before making dietary recommendations."
1433,"Langhana (fasting) is not useful for patients suffering from jwara caused by aggravated vata, by exhaustion, in chronic fevers, in fevers caused by kshata (external and internal injuries). Such patients should be treated by shamana therapy (alleviation therapy). [272]","Fasting, or Langhana, is a common practice in Ayurvedic medicine to help restore balance to the body. However, it is not recommended for certain types of jwara, or fever. Specifically, patients suffering from jwara caused by aggravated vata, exhaustion, chronic fevers, or fevers caused by kshata (external and internal injuries) should avoid fasting. Instead, these patients should be treated with shamana therapy, a type of alleviation therapy that aims to calm and soothe the body. This approach allows the body to focus on healing and recovery, rather than expending energy on digestion during a fast."
1434,"The aggravated doshas afflict the rasa dhatu and displace the agnī from the āmāshaya, for causing jwara. Thus, such patients have less of agni (digestive strength). ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, an imbalance in the doshas can lead to distressing symptoms, one of which is fever or jwara. When the doshas become excessive and aggravated, they can affect the rasa dhatu, or nutrient plasma, causing it to be impaired. As a consequence, the digestive fire or agni, which is located in the āmāshaya or stomach, becomes displaced and weakened. This results in the patient experiencing a reduced digestive strength, further exacerbating their health condition."
1435,"Even if a rice pot is kept on burning fire with enough fuel, the rice will not get cooked if the fire is blown out by a strong wind. ","In the realm of nature's kitchen, a striking metaphor unfolds. A rice pot, nestled upon a raging fire, remains fuelled and ready to cook our meal. Yet, when a powerful gust extinguishes the flames, even the most prepared hearth cannot complete its task. This ancient Sanskrit verse imparts timeless wisdom: that all the preparation and resources in the world may still fall short, if an unforeseen variable disrupts the essential element of progress."
1436,"Similarly, in a patient of jwara, the ūṡmā (digestive fire) is blown out of the paktī sthāna (place of digestion) and in this condition the consumed food is not digested properly. If the food is light, then also it gets digested with difficulty. ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, jwara, or fever, can have a significant impact on the digestive process. When jwara occurs, the ūṡmā, or digestive fire, is extinguished in the paktī sthāna, or place of digestion. This results in improper digestion of consumed food, regardless of whether it is light or heavy. Even food that would typically be easily digested becomes difficult to process under these circumstances, highlighting the far-reaching effects of jwara on the body's functioning."
1437,"Therefore, the line of treatment in jwara of langhana is useful for the preservation of the power of digestion. The malas of the seven dhatus get metabolized in seven days. ","In the context of managing fever (jwara) through a Langhana approach, it is noteworthy that this method plays a crucial role in maintaining the strength of digestion. This treatment line allows for the metabolism and elimination of waste products from the body's seven fundamental structures (dhatus) within a week-long period, thereby facilitating a comprehensive restoration process and promoting overall health."
1438,"Therefore, generally on the eighth day the jwara becomes nirama (free from the accumulated metabolic waste product). ","In the context of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, the duration and resolution of jwara (fever) are precisely studied and documented. After seven days of continuous fever, the eighth day often brings a certain relief. This is because, by this time, the body successfully manages to eliminate the accumulated metabolic waste products (doshas) caused by the fever. Consequently, the fever becomes nirama, or free from the built-up doshas, making the eighth day a significant turning point in the healing process."
1439,"If a person takes heavy food in the stage when the doshas are aggravated and the power of digestion is suppressed, he succumbs to death immediately, or becomes miserable for a long time. ","In the context of Ayurveda, consuming heavy foods during a time when the doshas are heightened and the digestive fire is diminished can have severe consequences. One may experience prolonged periods of discomfort and illness, or in extreme cases, even face the threat of immediate mortality. This highlights the importance of mindful eating habits and maintaining balance in one's diet and overall health."
1440,"Therefore, a wise physician should not immediately give either heavy or unctuous food in the beginning stage of jwara, even if it is caused by the aggravation of vata. ","In managing the initial stages of fever, known as jwara in Sanskrit, ancient medical texts advise caution when selecting dietary interventions. According to these teachings, a astute physician should avoid prescribing heavy or oily foods, even if the fever is a result of an aggravated vata dosha. The subtle nuances of this ancient wisdom offer valuable insights for modern healthcare practitioners seeking to integrate holistic approaches into their treatment strategies."
1441,"If the jwara is caused by vata and is not associated with the other two doshas then, in exception to the above rule the patient should be given massage and such other therapies. He should be given decoctions and meat or vegetable soups to drink. ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the treatment for jwara, or fever, varies depending on the underlying dosha involved. If vata is determined to be the primary cause, with no involvement of the other doshas, then the traditional approach recommends unconventional therapies such as massage. Soothing decoctions and either meat-based or vegetable-based soups are also suggested to provide comfort and nourishment to the patient during their recovery. This exception to the general rule highlights the importance of individualized treatment in Ayurveda, where each person's unique constitution and imbalances guide the choice of therapies."
1442,"Langhana and similar other therapies described in Langhanabrimhaniya Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana should be invariably administered in the following conditions:   When the jwara is in the sama stage When jwara is produced by the aggravated kapha dosha When both the kapha and the pitta dosha are aggravated together Vamana, virechana and basti therapies should be administered to cure the jwara caused by the aggravated vata, pitta and kapha dosha respectively. ","In the Langhanabrimhaniya Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana, specific therapies such as Langhana are highlighted as essential for managing certain health conditions. These therapies are particularly beneficial when the fever, known as Jwara, is in its equilibrium stage. Furthermore, they are recommended when Jwara is a result of an aggravated Kapha Dosha, and even more so when both Kapha and Pitta Doshas are heightened together. Specifically, Vamana (emesis), Virechana (purgation), and Basti (enema) therapies are advised to treat Jwara caused by the aggravated Vata, Pitta, and Kapha Doshas respectively."
1443,"In the case of saṁsṛṡṭra and sannīpātaja (in case of combination of two or all the three doshas) type of jwara, the tara, tama and sama (lesser, greater or equal) status of the vitiated doshas should be ascertained and the treatment planned according to the line of treatment and drugs prescribed for that dosha. ","In managing the complexities of saṁsṛṡṭra and sannīpātaja jwara, where two or three doshas combine to create an imbalance, it is essential to determine the severity of the vitiated doshas - tara (lesser), tama (greater), or sama (equal). By identifying the intensity of the affected doshas, medical practitioners can skillfully tailor treatments and medicines in accordance with the established line of treatment for each particular dosha. This approach allows for a more precise and effective healing process, bringing balance back to the body and restoring health."
1444,"Sannipātaja jwara should be treated by increasing one dosha, reducing the excessively aggravated one or by correcting the sites of the doshas in order, beginning with the site of kapha.[283-287]","Sannipātaja jwara, a dangerous feverish condition in Ayurveda, requires careful attention and treatment. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, there are three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - and an imbalance of these can lead to various health issues. In the case of Sannipātaja jwara, it is recommended that one dosha should be increased while reducing the excessively aggravated one. Additionally, correcting the sites of the doshas in a specific order, beginning with the site of kapha, can also prove beneficial in treating this condition. This holistic approach to healthcare has been used for centuries and continues to be relevant today, offering an alternative perspective on medical treatment."
1445,"A serious outcome of the sannipataja jwara is inflammation near the root of the ears which is a very serious condition and very few of such patients survive. Thus, efforts must be made immediately to cure it through therapeutic measures which alleviate kapha and pitta like blood letting, intake of ghee, pradeha (application of unction), navana (nasal instillation) and kavala graham (mouthful of liquid medication). [287-289]","The sannipataja jwara, a dangerous fever in Ayurvedic medicine, can lead to a severe inflammation near the ear root. This critical condition has a high mortality rate, with few patients surviving its onslaught. To combat this life-threatening complication, it is essential to take immediate action through therapeutic measures that aim to alleviate kapha and pitta imbalances. These treatments include bloodletting, ingesting ghee, applying unction, administering nasal instillations, and using mouthfuls of liquid medication. These interventions hold the key to mitigating the severity of this condition and enhancing the patient's chances of recovery."
1446,"When the jwara doesn’t get cured by either hot or cold or unctuous or ununctuous therapies etc., then it should be understood as śākhānusāri (that which is located in the peripheral tissues). Such type of fever gets cured by the administration of blood letting therapy. [289-290]","Fever, when proving resistant to various treatment methods including hot and cold therapies or the use of ointments, indicates a more complex condition. This stage of fever, known in Sanskrit as śākhānusāri, is localized in the peripheral tissues, demanding a specialized approach for cure. According to Ayurvedic texts, this type of fever responds positively to bloodletting therapy, highlighting the importance of traditional medical wisdom in addressing challenging health conditions. (289-290)"
1447,"If jwara arises in a patient as a complication of visarpa (erysipelas like disease), abhighāta (injury) and visphoṭaka (eruptions in the body), the patient in such case should be given ghee to drink provided kapha and pitta dosha are not aggravated. [290-291]","In the context of managing complex medical conditions, the ancient Sanskrit text, Astanga Hridayam, offers valuable insights. One such recommendation is for patients experiencing jwara (fever) as a complication of visarpa (erysipelas like disease), abhighata (injury), and visphotaka (eruptions in the body). The text suggests that in such cases, if kapha and pitta dosha are not exacerbated, ghee can be administered orally. This traditional wisdom underscores the importance of personalized medicine, taking into account the individual's unique constitutional balance."
1448,The fever turns chronic if there is weakness in the tissues of the body. Hence such patients should be given foods which promote the strength and are nourishing. [291-292],"In the context of health and wellness, it is essential to recognize the impact of a chronic fever on the body's tissues. According to a translation of a Sanskrit verse, if these tissues become weakened, the fever can persist and become increasingly difficult to shake off. To combat this, it is recommended that patients with chronic fevers consume foods that are both strengthening and nourishing. By providing the body with the nutrients it needs to heal and rebuild, these patients can better support their overall health and potentially reduce the duration of their fever."
1449,The general line of treatment of jwaras should not be followed for the management of tṛtīyaka and chaturthaka jwara as these two types of fever are mostly associated with āgantu or extraneous factors as būtās or evil spirits including germs. ,"When it comes to managing certain types of fever, such as tṛtīyaka and chaturthaka jwaras, traditional approaches may not be the most effective. This is because these particular fevers are often caused by external factors, including būtās or evil spirits, and even germs. Therefore, it is crucial to approach their treatment with this knowledge in mind, recognizing that they may require specialized care and consideration beyond general fever management practices."
1450,"When vāyu is predominantly aggravated in these two types of jwara, then they should be cured by the administration of ghee, niruha and anuvāsana bastīs (medicated enemas), unctuous and hot diet and drinks. ","In the context of addressing two specific types of fever, or jwara, where vāyu is the primary instigator, Ayurvedic wisdom offers a clear and precise course of action. The treatment regime involves the use of ghee, as well as medicated enemas of both niruha and anuvāsana varieties. Additionally, patients are advised to consume a diet that is rich in unctuousness and warmth, as these qualities help to counteract the aggravated vāyu. By following this multi-faceted approach, individuals can find relief from the discomforts of vāyu-predominant fevers and restore balance to their system."
1451,"When the pitta dosha is dominant the patient should be given purgation therapy, medicated milk, ghee and articles which are bitter and cold. ","In the context of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, it is crucial to balance the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - for optimal health. When the pitta dosha, which governs metabolism and digestion, becomes excessive, specific treatments are recommended to restore equilibrium. According to Sanskrit scholars, a suitable course of action when experiencing a pitta imbalance is to undergo purgation therapy and consume bitter and cold substances, including medicated milk and ghee. These recommendations highlight the personalized and holistic approach of Ayurveda in maintaining balance and promoting well-being."
1452,"In state of kapha predominance, then the patient should be administered emetic therapy, pachana (therapy which promotes the digestion and metabolism), ununctuous diet and drinks, fasting and hot decoctions are useful. [292-296]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the prevalence of kapha dosha in a patient calls for specific treatment measures. One such method is emetic therapy, which involves inducing vomiting to eliminate excess mucus and bile from the body. Additionally, pachana, or digestive therapies, are recommended to enhance metabolism and digestion. A nourishing and unctuous diet, along with hydrating drinks, can help counterbalance the cold and heavy qualities of kapha. Furthermore, fasting for a short period can aid in cleansing and rejuvenation. Finally, consuming hot decoctions made from medicinal herbs is useful to liquefy and expel kapha accumulations, thereby restoring balance and promoting overall health. [292-296]"
1453,"Formulations which are effective in curing jwara are being described. A wise physician should administer them, keeping in view their suitability for the type of dosha involved. These recipes are as follows –   Sura along with its manda (alcohol along with its supernatant part) as drink The meat of chicken, patridge and peacock are used as food Intake of medicated ghee called as shatapala; abhaya; triphala decoction; guduchi juice; preparation of nīlinī, ajagandhā, trivrita and kaṭurohiṇī during the onset of fever. These things should be administered to the patient appropriately, after the patient is given snehana and swedana therapies (oleation and sudation). ","The ancient Sanskrit text elucidates the remedies for jwara, or fever, with great precision. It emphasizes the role of a knowledgeable physician who can determine the most suitable formulation based on the patient's dosha type. The recommended remedies include alcoholic beverages, chicken, partridge, and peacock meat, as well as medicated ghee and various plant-based concoctions. These treatments must be administered carefully, following snehana (oleation) and swedana (sudation) therapies to ensure optimal efficacy. The inclusion of these specific ingredients and methods suggests a sophisticated understanding of the healing properties of different substances and their application in medical practice."
1454,"Emesis after the administration of ghee in large quantity Emesis after taking large quantity of food and drinks Sleeping after taking large quantity of alcohol along with food when the attack of fever is due Administration of āsthāpana and yāpanā bastīs Intake of cat’s stool mixed with milk on the same day Intake of cat’s stool mixed with either dadhi manḍa (scum of curd) or alcohol or rock salt or pippalī or triphalā or curd or butter or milk or ghee or panchagavya (mixture of five products obtained from cow); Intake of rasona along with oil immediately before food Intake of meat of animals which are fatty and hot in potency Inhalation of hingu and vasā of vyāghra (tiger) taken in equal quantity and mixed with rock salt.

It also mentions the intake of unusual concoctions such as cat's stool mixed with different substances like milk, curd, or butter. The text also recommends inhaling tiger's and lion's fumes, prepared by mixing their vasā (musk) with old ghee and rock salt, to prevent this issue. Moreover, it suggests applying anjana, a medicinal paste made from rock salt, pippalī seeds, and manaḥshilā, and undergoing fumigation using various herbs like nimba and vacā for the same purpose. The text further highlights the use of dhūma, dhūpana, nāvana, and other medicinal practices to prevent emesis."
1455,"Anjana (collyrium) which are prescribed in the treatment of manovikāra or psychic ailments like unmāda and apasamāra. Wearing of maṇis (precious stones and jewels), auṡadha (drugs), mangalya (auspicious talisman) and viṡa (poisonous substances) Intake of agada (antidote like drugs).[296-309]","The ancient practice of using Anjana, a type of collyrium, is recommended in the treatment of manovikāra or psychic disorders such as unmāda and apasamāra. In addition to this, other remedies like maṇis (precious stones), auṡadha (medicinal drugs), mangalya (auspicious talismans) and viṡa (poisonous substances) are also prescribed. Furthermore, the intake of agada (antidote drugs) is also an essential part of the treatment process. This holistic approach to mental health, as described in ancient Sanskrit texts, highlights the importance of considering various factors for a comprehensive treatment plan."
1456,"Prayers should be offered to lord Ishvara along with Umā, their attendents and matṛs. This immediately cures viṡama jwara. Recitation of the sahasra nāma (one thousand names) of Lord Viṡnū, who has one thousand heads, who is the chief of the carācara (moving and non-moving things of the universe) and who is omnipresent cures all type of jwara. Offering prayers through iṡṭī or yajña (fire ritual) to Brahmā, the Ashvinīs, īndra, āgni, the Himalayās, the Ganges and the followers of Māruts cures the jwara. Devotion to father and mother, prayer to gurūs, observance of celibacy, practice of tapa (penance), truthfulness and niyama (religious rites), japa (incantations), homa (like yajña – offering oblation to fire), hearing the recitation of the vedās and the darshana (visiting) of saints immediately cures jwara. [310-314]","The ancient Sanskrit text presents a cure for fever that is deeply rooted in religious devotion and practices. It suggests offering prayers to Lord Ishvara, along with Umā, their attendants, and matṛs to alleviate viṡama jwara.

Fire rituals or iṡṭī and yajña offered to Brahmā, Ashvinīs, īndra, āgni, the Himalayas, the Ganges, and the followers of Māruts can also provide relief from jwara. Additionally, leading a righteous life by following truthfulness, niyama, practicing tapa, observing celibacy, performing homa, hearing the vedās recitation, engaging in japa, and visiting saints can help cure fever."
1457,"When the doshas causing jwara are located in –  the rasa dhatu, then vamana and upavāsa (emesis and fasting) should be done. the rakta dhatu, then seka and pradeha (pouring of hot medicated liquids and ointment application) should be done. in the mamsa dhatu and the meda dhatu virecana and upavāsa should be done. in the asthi dhatu and majja dhatus, nirūha and anuvāsana bastis should be given. [315-317]","In the context of managing jwara (fever) in Ayurvedic medicine, the location of the doshas (the three biological energies) is crucial in determining the appropriate treatment. When the doshas are situated in the rasa dhatu (plasma tissue), vamana (emesis) and upavasa (fasting) are recommended. Conversely, if they reside in the rakta dhatu (blood tissue), then seka (pouring of hot medicated liquids) and pradeha (ointment application) become the preferred course of action. In cases where the doshas are present in the mamsa dhatu (muscle tissue) and meda dhatu (fat tissue), virecana (purgation) and upavasa (fasting) are advised. Lastly, for those instances where the doshas are located in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and majja dhatus (nerve tissue), niruha (decotion enema) and anuvasana bastis (oil enema) should be administered. This ancient wisdom from the Sanskrit verse provides a holistic and personalized approach to managing jwara, based on the individual's specific needs and conditions. [315-317]"
1458,"The jwara caused by shapa (curse), abhichara (tantric rituals with evil purpose), bhutabhishanga (affliction by micro organisms or evil spirits), daiva vyapashraya chikitsa (performance of spiritual therapies) is the most desired therapy. [317]","The ancient Sanskrit text presents a profound perspective on healing, specifically when it comes to jwara or fever. It suggests that when fever arises from shapa (curse), abhichara (black magic), bhutabhishanga (possession by spirits or microorganisms), the most appropriate treatment is daiva vyapashraya chikitsa – spiritual therapies such as prayers, mantras, and rituals. This ancient wisdom underscores the importance of addressing not just the physical symptoms but also the underlying causes, whether they are spiritual or supernatural, to restore balance and health."
1459,"Jwara caused by abhighāta (external injury) gets cured by the intake and massage of ghee, blood letting, in take of rice with wholesome meat soup. If such patients of abhighata jwara, are suffering from anaha (gaseous distention of abdomen) and are accustomed to alcohol, then they should be given food with alcohol and meat soup. For the treatment of jwara caused by kshata (injury like cuts, stabs etc.) and vraṇa (ulcers) line of treatment suggested for kshata and vrana should be adopted. [318-320]","In the ancient Ayurvedic text, Charaka Samhita, a Sanskrit verse describes the treatment for fever (jwara) caused by external injury (abhighāta). The recommended therapy includes the consumption and massage of ghee, bloodletting, and the intake of rice with wholesome meat soup. For patients who are also experiencing abdominal distention (anaha) and have a history of alcohol consumption, the text advises incorporating alcohol and meat soup into their diet. In cases of fever caused by injury (kshata) or ulcers (vraṇa), the suggested course of treatment aligns with that for kshata and vraṇa management. This ancient wisdom provides a unique perspective on addressing fever and related symptoms through targeted nutrition and therapeutic practices."
1460,"The jwara caused by kāma (passion), shoka (grief) and bhaya (fear) gets cured by the āshvāshana (assurance), ishṭa labha (providing the desired object), alleviation of vāyu and harshana (bringing excitement). The jwara caused by krodha gets subsided by providing the kamya artha (desired object), manojna artha (pleasing object), therapies for the alleviation of pitta and sadvakya (correct advice). The jwara caused by krodha gets subsided by kama and that caused by kama gets cured by krodha. Jwara caused by bhaya (fear) and shoka (grief or sorrow) gets subsided by both kama and krodha. If a patient gets jwara just by thinking about its episode, then his mind should be diverted to desirable, different and surprising incidents (vishaya).[320-323]","In the realm of Ayurveda, fever or jwara is not merely a physical symptom but can also be caused by emotional imbalances such as passion, grief, fear, and anger. The ancient Sanskrit text recommends specific remedies to alleviate fever caused by these emotions. For instance, fever caused by excessive desire or kama can be cured by providing assurance, the desired object, and through therapies that regulate vayu and excitement. On the other hand, fever caused by anger or krodha requires the provision of the desired object, pleasing objects, and therapies to balance pitta. Interestingly, it suggests that fever caused by one emotion can be cured by its opposite - for example, using kama to cure fever caused by krodha, and vice versa. Furthermore, in cases where thinking about the illness intensifies the fever, the mind should be diverted towards desirable, different, and surprising incidents to alleviate it."
1461,"The clinical features manifested at the time of remission of (sannipata jwara) are – the patient produces kujana (rumbling) sound, vomiting, abnormal movements of the limbs (cheshta), heavy breathing or difficulty in breathing, discoloration, svinna anga (sweating), trembling (vepate), frequent fainting (lihyate muhuḥ), delirium, the body becoming very hot and cold at times, unconsciousness, more rise of temperature, angry appearance and forceful passage of liquid stools mixed with doshas with sound. If a severe condition of jwara with excessively aggravated doshas and recent onset, is treated with appropriate therapy, then dosha paka occurs. Because of this, the sudden remission of jwara occurs with difficulty (daruna moksha).  In chronic stage of jwara, the episodes are remitted depending upon strength of dosha. The remission occurs slowly without difficulty. [324-328]","In the context of sannipata jwara, or a fever caused by the aggravation of all three doshas, the symptoms that arise during remission are quite distinctive. The patient may exhibit a rumbling stomach, bouts of vomiting, abnormal limb movements, irregular breathing patterns, discoloration, sweating, tremors, frequent fainting, delirious behavior, alternating between hot and cold flashes, unconsciousness, increased temperature, and an angry demeanor. Additionally, they may experience forceful passage of liquid stools mixed with doshas. In cases of severe jwara with recently aggravated doshas, treating the condition promptly can lead to dosha paka or digestion of the doshas, which may result in a sudden and difficult remission. However, in chronic stages of jwara, the episodes of fever tend to subside gradually without much difficulty, depending upon the strength of the aggravated doshas. (Translation from Sanskrit verses 324-328)"
1462,"Disappearance of klama (mental fatigue) and santapa (temperature), absence of pain, clarity of senses, gaining natural mental faculties – are all the signs and symptoms of a person who has become free from jwara.[329]","A significant indication of freedom from fever in an individual is the disappearance of klama and santapa. Klama, or mental fatigue, vanishes, leading to increased clarity and focus. Similarly, santapa, or physical temperature, subsides, ensuring a state of comfort. The individual experiences a relief from pain and a heightened sense of awareness. Importantly, their natural mental faculties are regained, allowing them to function at their optimal level. These signs and symptoms collectively point towards a state of well-being, signaling the successful recovery from jwara."
1463,"A person suffering from jwara and the one who has become free from it should not indulge in and avoid the following - the intake of food and drinks which are vidahi (causing burning sensation), guru (heavy), asatmya (unwholesome) and viruddha (mutually contradictory); sexual intercourse, excessive exhaustion, bath and excessive walking. By observing these rules the fever gets alleviated and does not occur again.  Exercise, sexual intercourse, bath, chankramana (brisk walk) – these should be avoided by the person who has become free from jwara till he regains strength. [330-332]","According to ancient Sanskrit texts, individuals on the road to recovery from fever or ""jwara"" must adhere to specific dietary and lifestyle restrictions for a swift and sustained recovery. These guidelines advise against consuming foods and beverages that are vidahi (burning), guru (heavy), asatmya (unwholesome), and viruddha (contradictory) in nature. Additionally, one should avoid activities such as sexual intercourse, excessive exhaustion, bathing, and brisk walking during this period. Following these guidelines will not only alleviate the symptoms of fever but also prevent its return. Post-recovery, one must continue to avoid strenuous exercise, sexual activity, bathing, and brisk walking until regaining full strength."
1464,"If a person, who has become free from jwara, resorts to prohibited factors (as described before) before gaining strength, then the jwara reappears. ","In the context of Ayurveda, jwara or fever is not just a symptom but a specific bodily response to an imbalance. Even after successfully overcoming a fever, one must be cautious about their actions and choices. If a person, now recovered, indulges in prohibited factors such as excessive intake of food or sensory stimulation before regaining full strength, they risk the return of the fever. This highlights the interconnectedness of all aspects of health and well-being, and the importance of mindful living even after recovering from an ailment."
1465,"If a person becomes free from jwara when the doshas have not been eliminated properly, then, even with mild irregularity in regimens (apachara), it reappears. As such patients have already suffered for a long time; hence there is weakness and loss of vitality in the tissues. If the fever reappears in them and then this certainly leads to their death. ","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, even if an individual appears to have recovered from a feverish illness, known as jwara, there remains a risk for recurrence if the underlying dosha imbalance has not been fully addressed. This is because any disruption in their dietary or lifestyle routine (apachara) can trigger a relapse of the fever. Given that these patients have likely already endured a lengthy period of sickness, they are often left with depleted tissues and weakened vitality. Consequently, should a recurrence of fever take place in such cases, it could potentially result in fatality."
1466,"Sometimes, doshas undergo paripāka (metabolic transformation) in the dhatus and gradually the fever subsides. ","In the context of Ayurveda, doshas, the bodily humor consisting of air, bile, and phlegm, sometimes undergo a metabolic transformation known as paripāka within the dhatus or tissues. This natural process, when functioning optimally, aids in the gradual subsiding of fever, allowing the body to restore balance and maintain homeostasis. Through this intricate mechanism, our bodies demonstrate yet another example of their innate wisdom and ability to heal, as they transform and eliminate excess doshas, ultimately promoting health and well-being."
1467,"But, their harmful effects continue as a result of which the patient suffers from dīnata (uneasiness), shvayathu (edema), glani (lassitude), panduta (pallor or anemia), loss of appetite, itching, urticaria, pimples and suppression of the power of digestion.  Similarly, other diseases which are already cured reappear in the individual due to the non – elimination of the doshas completely, even by resorting to little unwholesome regime after the cure of the disease. ","The lingering effects of improperly treated ailments can have serious consequences on an individual's health. When the root causes, or ""doshas,"" of a disease are not completely eliminated, the patient may continue to suffer from symptoms such as uneasiness (dīnata), edema (shvayathu), lassitude (glani), pallor or anemia (panduta), loss of appetite, itching, urticaria, pimples, and weakened digestion. Furthermore, previously cured diseases may reappear due to even minor deviations from a healthy lifestyle post-treatment. The importance of thorough and proper medical care cannot be overstated, as incomplete treatment can lead to unnecessary suffering and the return of past ailments."
1468,"Therefore, the doshas should be eliminated from the body either by elimination or alleviation therapies depending upon the stage and strength of the doshas, even after the fever subsides in a patient of jwara. For this purpose mild elimination therapies and yāpanā bastīs should be administered. Yūśa (vegetable soups) and rasa (meat soups) of animal’s meat, which are light, are useful in this condition. ","In the context of managing jwara or fever, it is crucial to continue addressing the underlying doshas even after the fever has subsided. The approach to eliminating or alleviating the doshas depends on their stage and strength within the body. For this purpose, mild elimination therapies such as bastis (enemas) with medicinal decoctions can be administered. Additionally, consuming light and easily digestible foods like yusha (vegetable soups) and rasas (meat soups), particularly from animals, can aid in the recovery process."
1469,"Abhyanga, udvartana, snāna, dhūpana, anjana and ghee prepared boiling with bitter drugs are useful in the treatment of jwara, which has reappeared in a patient. If the fever reappears because of the intake of food which is guru (heavy), abhiṡyandī (which cause obstruction in the channels of the body) and unwholesome; then langhana (fasting) and hot therapies should be administered for its treatment as described before. ","In the realm of Ayurveda, ancient Indian medicine, Abhyanga, Udvartana, and snāna are recommended to manage reoccurring fever (jwara) after its initial treatment. These therapies involve soothing oil massages, herbal scrubs, and medicated baths. Additionally, dhūpana (medicated fumigation), anjana (collyrium), and ghee boiled with bitter drugs can also be beneficial. However, if the fever returns due to consuming heavy, obstructive, and unwholesome food, fasting and hot therapies should once again be employed as a course of treatment. This approach aims to restore balance in the body and alleviate symptoms, adhering to Ayurvedic principles."
1470,"Habitual intake of the decoction of kirāta tiktaka, tiktā, mustā; parpaṭaka and amṛtā cures repeated fever. [333-343]","In the realm of ancient Ayurvedic medicine, a powerful concoction known as kirāta tiktaka, tiktā, mustā; parpaṭaka and amṛtā has been revered for its remarkable curative properties. According to the sacred texts, regular consumption of this decoction is said to provide a cure for persistent fever, offering respite and healing to those who suffer from this debilitating affliction. This potent blend of herbs and botanicals harnesses the natural restorative abilities of nature, working to bolster the body's defenses and promote overall well-being. For those seeking solace from recurring fever, this age-old remedy may offer a path towards renewed health and vitality."
1471,"The wise physician should treat the patient in different stages of jwara, according to the line of treatment of jwara. [344]","In the medical field, the understanding of jwara, or fever, is crucial for physicians seeking to provide effective treatment. The sage Charaka, in his ancient Sanskrit texts, emphasized the importance of tailoring treatment to the different stages of jwara. This time-tested approach allows healthcare providers to deliver more personalized and accurate care, ensuring that their patients receive the most appropriate remedies for their unique conditions. By following this ancient wisdom, modern physicians can enhance their practice and improve patient outcomes."
1472,"Jwara is the king of diseases and it causes the death of all creatures and is of serious nature. Therefore, the physician should make special efforts for its treatment. [345]","In the realm of health and wellness, few foes are as formidable as Jwara, the Sanskrit term for fever, often referred to as the ""king of diseases."" Its erythalic grip knows no boundaries, indiscriminately seizing control over the bodies of all creatures, relentless in its pursuit. The gravity of its impact on life's fragile balance cannot be overstated; it is a force of nature that demands our utmost respect and attention. As such, physicians must rise to this challenge, employing their skills and knowledge with unwavering dedication to combating Jwara's devastating effects and ensuring the well-being of those entrusted to their care [345]."
1473,"With a desire for the welfare of the living creatures, Atreya has furnished the replies to the queries of Agniveśa regarding the treatment of jwara. [347]","In the ancient text of Ayurveda, a profound exchange between two great sages, Atreya and Agnivesha, is recorded. The topic of their dialogue was jwara, or fever, a common ailment that continues to affect many individuals even today. Motivated by a deep concern for the well-being of all living beings, Atreya generously shared his knowledge and expertise on this matter, providing valuable insights into the treatment of fever. His compassionate intentions are evident in his detailed responses to Agnivesha's questions, demonstrating the enduring significance of Ayurveda in promoting health and healing."
1474,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Apasmara Chikitsa""(Management of Epilepsy and other disorders). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the vast field of medical literature, the focus now turns to a significant topic: ""Apasmara Chikitsa,"" or the management of epilepsy and other disorders. This profound knowledge is shared by none other than Lord Atreya, a revered figure in medical history, thereby highlighting its importance and relevance in the Ayurvedic context."
1475,The expert physicians call apasmara as 'going away of memory' characterized by black-outs (feeling of entering into darkness) and revolting movements caused by conglomeration of the intellect and the mind. [3],"In the realm of medical expertise, Apasmara is a term that holds significant meaning. Often described as the 'going away of memory,' this condition is associated with sudden blackouts and unsettling movements. At the core of Apasmara lies an intriguing phenomenon - the conglomeration of the intellect and the mind. This merging of cognitive forces creates a complex web that results in the array of symptoms associated with Apasmara, making it a fascinating area of study for physicians and researchers alike."
1476,"Apasmara occurs in those persons, in whom:  The doshas are excessively aggravated and have spread to other sites (vibhranta) due to (habitual) intake of improper/harmful and impure/contaminated food. In whom, the sattva (one of the attributes of mind representing purity and consciousness) is suppressed by rajas (attribute of the mind representing energy and dynamism) and tamas (attribute of the mind representing passivity and ignorance) ; The heart (site of consciousness) is obscured by aggravated doshas; and Mind is distressed or annihilated by (affliction of negative emotions like) worry, passion, fright, anger, grief, anxiety etc.  [4-5]","Apasmara, a Sanskrit term meaning ""memory loss"" or ""loss of consciousness,"" is a condition that arises in individuals due to the consumption of impure and harmful foods. When the doshas, or bodily humors, become excessively aggravated and spread to other parts of the body, this state of vitiation can lead to Apasmara. Furthermore, when the sattva, or pure consciousness, is suppressed by rajas and tamas, the attributes representing energy, dynamism, passivity, and ignorance, respectively, the individual becomes more susceptible to this condition. The heart, the site of consciousness, may become obscured by the aggravated doshas, and a troubled or annihilated mind, caused by afflictive emotions such as worry, passion, fright, anger, grief, and anxiety, can also contribute to the onset of Apasmara."
1477,"(By the above mentioned factors) doshas located in the vessels (or dhamani, channels that carry nutrients) afflict the heart. Thus person suffers due to bewildered mind.[6]  He visualizes non-existent forms (visual hallucinations), falls down, his tongue, eyes and eyebrows become tremulous, saliva discharges from his mouth, his hands and legs are extended / bent.[7]","The location of doshas in the body's vessels can have significant consequences for an individual's well-being. According to ancient Sanskrit texts, when these doshas accumulate in the channels that carry nutrients, they can ultimately afflict the heart. This affliction may lead to a bewildered state of mind and cause one to experience visual hallucinations, loss of balance, tremors in the facial features, excessive salivation, and unusual movements in the limbs. Such symptoms point to the severity of an imbalance in the body's natural systems and underscore the importance of maintaining harmony within."
1478,"When the surge of doshas is over, he wakes up as if he is getting up from sleep (regains consciousness). [8]","After the storm of imbalanced bodily humors, known as doshas in Ayurvedic medicine, has run its course, the individual gradually regains consciousness. This return to awareness is akin to waking up from sleep, where one slowly emerges from a state of unconsciousness to a renewed sense of alertness and clarity. The ebb and flow of doshas can significantly impact an individual's health and well-being, making it crucial to maintain their balance through proper diet, lifestyle, and holistic self-care practices."
1479,"Apasmara is of four types including those due to separate doshas (vata, pitta and kapha) and due to combination of all (sannipatika). [8]","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, Apasmara, or epilepsy, is classified into four distinct categories. These categories are based on the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - that govern an individual's physical and mental health. The first three types of Apasmara are caused by a vitiation in one of these doshas, while the fourth type, known as sannipatika, is a result of an imbalance in all three doshas. Understanding these different types of Apasmara is crucial in formulating effective treatment strategies in Ayurveda."
1480,"Vatika apasmara is characterized by trembling, grinding of teeth, frothing from the mouth, and gasping. The patient gets visual hallucinations of objects which are rough, reddish brown or black in color. [9]","The Sanskrit term ""Vatika apasmara"" refers to a specific medical condition that is characterized by distinct symptoms and unusual visual hallucinations. Those afflicted with this condition experience trembling, teeth grinding, and frothing at the mouth, as well as gasping for breath. But what sets this ailment apart are the vivid hallucinations of objects that are predominantly rough in texture and colored in shades of reddish-brown or black. The unique nature of these symptoms offers a fascinating glimpse into ancient medical thought and the understanding of neurological disorders in antiquity."
1481,"Paittika apasmara is characterized by yellowish froth, body, face and eyes. He gets visual hallucinations of yellow or blood-red objects. He has thirst, hot sensation (sensation of heat), and sees fire all over his surroundings. [10]","The Paittika apasmara is a specific form of epilepsy, as described in ancient Sanskrit texts, characterized by distinctive yellowish foam, complexion, facial features, and eyes. This manifestation also includes visual hallucinations, where the individual sees objects tinted with shades of yellow or blood-red. Furthermore, an affected person experiences excessive thirst and a strong sensation of heat throughout their body, accompanied by a striking perception of fire in their surroundings. This unique depiction showcases the depth of understanding of various medical conditions present in ancient Sanskrit literature."
1482,"The shlaishmika apasmara is characterized by whitish froth (from the mouth), body, face and eyes, (feeling of) cold, heaviness due to stiff body. The patient gets hallucinations of white objects and recovers late. [11]","The shlaishmika apasmara is a specific type of epilepsy, characterized by distinct symptoms that set it apart in traditional Sanskrit medical texts. The patient is marked by a striking physical appearance, with a body, face, and eyes turning an unusual white shade, accompanied by frothy white foam from the mouth. A pervasive feeling of coldness and bodily stiffness adds to the heaviness, making movement difficult. Interestingly, the patient also developes hallucinations of white objects, further contributing to the unique set of symptoms. Recovery tends to be slow in these cases, making early intervention and appropriate treatment crucial in managing this condition, as described in ancient Ayurvedic literature [11]."
1483,"Tridoshaja apasmara is characterized by manifestation of all of above features at the same time. This type of apasmara is incurable. The apasmara, which occurs in emaciated person and in chronic stage, is also incurable. [12]","The Sanskrit verse reveals that a particular form of epilepsy, known as Tridoshaja apasmara, is identified by the simultaneous presence of all associated features. This severe manifestation of the condition is regrettably labeled as incurable. Furthermore, the verse sheds light on another type of apasmara that develops during an emaciated state or chronic stages, which also carries a grim prognosis of being incurable. The gravity and impact of these types of apasmara are indeed a cause for concern, prompting further research into potential mitigation strategies."
1484,"The vitiated doshas lead to paroxysms of apasmara once in fifteen days, twelve days or a month. The paroxysm may occur even after a shorter period.[13]","The balance of the three fundamental energies, or doshas, is crucial for the maintenance of health and well-being in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. However, when these doshas become vitiated or imbalanced, they can lead to a variety of health issues. According to a Sanskrit verse, one such consequence of vitiated doshas is apasmara, or seizures. These seizures may occur at regular intervals, with paroxysms occurring once every fifteen days, twelve days, or even after just a month. However, it's important to note that the timing of these seizures can be unpredictable and may occur more frequently than these specified intervals.

1485,"The heart, channels and mind which are obstructed by doshas shall rouse up or cleared first by strong remedial measures like vamana (emetic therapy) etc. [14]","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, a blocked heart, constricted channels, and a clouded mind caused by dosha imbalances require powerful healing measures to restore harmony. Vamana, or therapeutic emesis, is one such strong remedial method used to clear these obstructions. By effectively eliminating excess doshas, this therapeutic approach helps rejuvenate the body and enable a healthier flow of energy throughout the system, ultimately promoting overall well-being and balance."
1486,Vatika apasmara shall be treated mainly with basti (medicated enema) therapy; Paittika apasmara shall mainly be treated with virechana (purgation) therapy and shlaishmika apasmara shall mainly be treated with vamana (emesis) therapy.[15],"In the realm of Ayurveda, a ancient Indian system of medicine, specific treatments are recommended for different types of epilepsy, known as Apasmara. The Sanskrit verse outlines these treatments, with Vatika Apasmara being mainly treated with Basti (medicated enema) therapy. Paittika Apasmara is to be predominantly managed through Virechana (purgation) therapy, while Shlaishmika Apasmara responds well to Vamana (emesis) therapy. This centuries-old wisdom highlights the importance of personalized medicine and tailoring treatments to individual's specific needs."
1487,"After proper purification is done by all above therapies and well assurance is given, the pacification formulations for relief from apasmara are described henceforth.[16]","In the ancient Indian medical science of Ayurveda, great emphasis is placed on achieving a state of purification before administering any treatment. This passage describes the next step in the process of treating a particular ailment known as apasmara. Following the successful completion of various purifying therapies and with the assurance of optimal readiness for healing, the section dedicated to the pacification formulations designed to alleviate apasmara begins here.

1500,"Pippali, rock-salt, chitra (danti), hingu, hingushivatika (vamsa-patrika), kakoli, sarshapa, kakanasa, kaitarya, chandana and shoulder bones, nails and ribs of the dog should be made to a paste by triturating with goat's urine in the constellation of pusya (8th nakshatra, or constellation, per Vedic astrology). Use of this for pradeha (external application in the form of thick paste) and dhupana (fumigation) cures epilepsy.[37-38]","In the ancient Indian medical tradition, a unique concoction made from a specific set of ingredients is recommended for the treatment of epilepsy. The components include pippali, rock-salt, chitra (danti), hingu, hingushivatika (vamsa-patrika), kakoli, sarshapa, kakanasa, kaitarya, chandana, as well as the shoulder bones, nails, and ribs of a dog. The Vedic astrology constellation of Pusya is considered auspicious for preparing this remedy. The ingredients are triturated with goat's urine to create a paste-like consistency, which is then applied externally as a thick paste (pradeha) and used for fumigation (dhupana). This traditional treatment practice has been passed down through generations, highlighting the richness of ancient medical knowledge."
1501,"Juice of apetarakshasi (tulasi), kushtha, putanakeshi (jatamansi) and choraka should be triturated by adding (cow's or goat's) urine and made to a paste. This should be used as unction (for the treatment of epilepsy). The body of the patient should be sprinkled with the urine (of cow or goat).[39]","In the traditional Indian medical system of Ayurveda, a unique concoction is recommended for the treatment of epilepsy. This unction includes the juice of potent herbs such as apetarakshasi, or holy basil (tulasi), kushtha, and putanakeshi, also known as jatamansi. These juices are triturated, or ground, with the addition of urine from a cow or goat to form a paste. The patient is to be anointed with this mixture while the body is simultaneously sprinkled with the same type of animal urine. This therapy is believed to provide relief for those suffering from epileptic seizures, harnessing the power of these natural ingredients in a truly unique way."
1502,"Similarly, unction should be done with the help of the following:    stool of leeches; ashes of the small hair of the goat. ashes of the bone of ass; ashes of the nails of elephant; and ashes of the hair in the tail of the cow.  [40]","In the ancient practice of unction, or anointing, there are specific ingredients derived from various sources that hold great significance. According to the Sanskrit verse, one should incorporate the stool of leeches, as well as the ashes of the small hair of a goat. The ashes of an ass's bone and the nails of an elephant are also included. Lastly, the ashes of the hair in a cow's tail must be added to complete this traditional concoction. These elements, when combined, are believed to possess unique properties that make the unction ritual spiritually potent."
1503,"Inhalation of the urine of cow having reddish brown (kapila) color is extremely useful for the cure of epilepsy. Similarly, inhalation of the urine of the dog, jackal, cat, lion etc., is useful in this condition. [41]","The ancient practice of inhaling certain animal urines may sound unusual, but according to Sanskrit scholars, it has been suggested as a potential remedy for epilepsy. Specifically, the reddish-brown cow's urine is believed to have therapeutic properties that can aid in the treatment of this condition. Moreover, it is not just limited to cows; other animals such as dogs, jackals, cats, and lions are also mentioned in the texts. The inhalation of their urines, again of specific colors, is touted for its potential benefits in managing epilepsy. However, it is crucial to approach these alternative therapies with caution and consult with healthcare professionals before incorporating them into any medical treatment."
1504,"Bhargi, vacha and nagadanti (kasthapatala) triturated with cow's urine; shveta (shveta aparajita) and shveta vishanika (shatavari) triturated with cow's urine; jyotishmati and nagadanti triturated with cow's urine. Inhalation of five or six drops of the foregoing three recipes is useful (in the treatment of epilepsy); [42-43]","Epilepsy, a challenging neurological condition, has been addressed in ancient Sanskrit texts with remarkable insights. The Kashthapala, Nagadanti, and Bhargi are combined with cow's urine, forming the first remedy. The second recipe features Shveta and Shveta Vishanika (Shatavari), also triturated with cow's urine. Lastly, Jyotishmati and Nagadanti are mixed with cow's urine to create the third concoction. According to the text, inhaling a few drops of these mixtures can provide relief for individuals suffering from epilepsy. While these ancient remedies may seem unconventional, they offer a unique perspective on therapeutic approaches and the potential value of traditional knowledge in modern healthcare research."
1505,"Oil (one part) should be cooked with goat’s urine (four parts) and the paste of haritaki, bibhitaki, amalaki, shunthi, pippali, maricha, pitadru (devadaru), yavakshara, phaninjhaka, shyama, apamarga and fruits of karanja. (One fourth part in total). Inhalation of this medicated oil cures apasmara (epilepsy).[43-44]","The ancient practice of Ayurveda offers an intriguing remedy for epilepsy, known as apasmara in Sanskrit. This treatment involves creating a unique concoction by combining goat's urine and oil, along with the paste of several herbs including haritaki, bibhitaki, amalaki, shunthi, pippali, maricha, pitadru (devadaru), yavakshara, phaninjhaka, shyama, apamarga, and the fruits of karanja. The ratio is four parts of goat's urine to one part of oil, with the mixture of herbs comprising one fourth part in total. Once prepared, inhalation of this medicated oil is believed to provide relief from epilepsy symptoms, offering hope and healing through traditional Ayurvedic wisdom."
1506,"The powder of pippali, vrishchikali, kushtha, saindhava, lavana, sauvarchala lavana, samudra lavana, vida lavana, audbhida lavana (vide sutra 1:88-89) and bhargi should be administered in the form of pradhamana nasya (in which powders of drugs are blown into the nostrils of the patient.) This is an excellent recipe (for curing epilepsy).[45]","The ancient medical science of Ayurveda offers a promising approach for the treatment of epilepsy. A notable preparation includes a blend of powdered pippali, vrishchikali, kushtha, saindhava, lavana, sauvarchala lavana, samudra lavana, vida lavana, audbhida lavana, and bhargi. As outlined in the sutras, these ingredients are to be administered through pradhamana nasya, a process where the powder mixture is blown into the nostrils. This traditional remedy has been considered an excellent recipe for managing epileptic seizures, providing an alternative avenue for those seeking holistic healing practices."
1507,"Kayastha, sharada mudga (harita mudga), musta, ushira, yava, sunthi, pippali and maricha should be made to a paste by triturating with goat’s urine. From out of this paste, vartis (elongated pills/wicks) should be prepared. [46]  Application of this thin paste (prepared by rubbing with water) in the eyes (as collyrium) works like ambrosia in (curing) apasmara (epilepsy), unmada (insanity), snake-bite, Afflictions by poisonous beverages, internal poisonings and to regain consciousness after drowning  [47]","The Kayastha concoction, a potent paste made from sharada mudga, musta, ushira, yava, sunthi, pippali, and maricha, is created through the unique process of trituration with goat's urine. This remedy has been celebrated for its healing properties, particularly in the treatment of various severe conditions such as apasmara (epilepsy), unmada (insanity), and afflictions caused by snake bites and poisonous beverages. The application of this thin paste, derived from rubbing it with water, serves as a topical remedy when applied to the eyes in the form of a collyrium. Moreover, it is believed to restore consciousness after drowning and cure internal poisonings, offering a glimmer of hope for those grappling with these debilitating health issues."
1508,"Musta, vayastha, triphala, kayastha, hingu, shadwal, vyosha, masha, yava should be made to a paste by triturating in urines of goat, sheep and bull.   From this paste, vartis (elongated pills) should be prepared. (These vartis should be rubbed over a stone by adding water, and the thin paste, thus obtained, should be used as collyrium). This is used in treatment of apasmara (epilepsy), kilasa (a type of leucoderma), unmada (insanity) and vishama jwara (irregular fever).[48-49]","The ancient wisdom of Ayurveda has long advocated the use of unique formulations to treat ailments, with one such preparation involving the creation of paste made from ingredients like musta, vayastha, triphala, kayastha, hingu, shadwal, vyosha, masha, and yava. This paste is created by triturating these herbs in the urines of a goat, sheep, and bull. From this resulting mixture, elongated pills called vartis are prepared, which are then rubbed over a stone with water to create a thin paste. This fine paste, known for its healing properties, has been traditionally used as a collyrium to treat epilepsy (apasmara), leucoderma (kilasa), insanity (unmada), and irregular fever (vishama jwara). The enduring legacy of such Ayurvedic practices underscores the importance of harnessing nature's resources for therapeutic purposes."
1509,"Dog-bile, collected during pushya constellation, should be used as collyrium for the cure of apasmara (epilepsy). This (bile) mixed with ghee should be used for fumigation which is excellent (for curing epilepsy).[50]","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, every constellation and planetary alignment holds significance in the treatment of diseases. According to a Sanskrit verse, dog-bile collected during the Pushya constellation is considered an effective remedy for epilepsy. As a collyrium, it is applied on the patient's eyelids, while its fumigation with ghee, when performed accurately, can help cure this neurological disorder. The unique properties of dog-bile during Pushya constellation and the therapeutic application of ghee make this treatment method worth exploring for those seeking alternative therapies for epilepsy."
1510,"(For the treatment of epilepsy), the physician should give fumigation therapy with the help of the beaks, feather and stool of mongoose, owl, cat, vulture, kita (scorpion etc), snake and crow.  [51]","In the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda, there exists a unique treatment approach for epilepsy that involves the use of unconventional animal-derived substances. According to Sushruta Samhita, an ancient scripture, the physician is recommended to administer fumigation therapy using the beaks, feathers, and stool of specific animals, including a mongoose, owl, cat, vulture, scorpion, snake, and crow. While this may seem unusual in modern times, it reflects the deep-rooted understanding of these natural resources in traditional Indian medicine."
1511,"With the help of these therapies, the heart of the patient gets stimulated and the channels get cleansed as a result of which the patient regains consciousness.[52]","In the realm of healing, there exists a profound approach that harnesses the power of therapy to stimulate the heart and clear the channels of the body. This ancient practice, deeply rooted in the wisdom of Sanskrit texts, describes how such therapies can have a transformative impact on an individual's consciousness. As the heart is awakened and the pathways are cleansed, patients who were once unconscious begin to regain awareness, revealing the extraordinary potential of these healing practices."
1512,"In some patients of epilepsy, exogenous factors are secondarily involved and in such cases signs and symptoms are manifested over and above those of the doshas (endogenous factors). Such patients should be treated on the lines suggested for exogenous types of unmada (insanity) (refer to Chapter 9 of this section, i.e., Unmada Chikitsa).[53].","In the complex world of medical treatment, even the field of epilepsy sees its own set of intricacies. Some patients' experiences extend beyond the realm of endogenous factors, or ""doshas,"" as they are known in Sanskrit. When exogenous factors come into play, secondary to these primary internal imbalances, a patient's condition may worsen and exhibit additional signs and symptoms. In such instances, it becomes necessary to approach the treatment plan from an alternative perspective. Drawing from the teachings of Chapter 9 in Unmada Chikitsa, healthcare providers must manage these unique cases as they would those suffering from exogenous types of insanity or ""unmada."""
1513,"Thereafter, Agnivesha with folded hands [in salutation] said, ""O Lord!  In Sutra Sthana (Sutra 19 : 3) you have mentioned in brief as a mahagada (grave disease), that is atattvabhinivesha (pervaded by false principles ). But its etiology, signs and symptoms and treatment are not described there. I want to hear these descriptions. Kindly narrate them in the present context"".[54-55]  Having heard this, Lord Punarvasu addressed his disciple who was desirous of hearing and said, ""My child, hear about this mahagada (grave disease) along with its etiology, signs and symptoms and treatment"".  [56]","In the Sutra Sthana, a concise reference is made to atattvabhinivesha, a grave disease that is pervaded by false principles. Agnivesha, with deep reverence, approaches the Lord with a humble request to elucidate further on its causes, symptoms, and treatment. This great sage seeks knowledge to understand this mahagada in greater depth. Pleased by his disciple's eagerness to learn, Lord Punarvasu begins to narrate the intricacies of atattvabhinivesha, delving into its etiology, the signs and symptoms that define it, and the appropriate treatments to manage it, providing valuable insights into this complex medical condition."
1514,"If a person is indulged in habitual intake of impure food, due to suppression of manifested natural urges, excessive intake of cold, hot, unctuous, un-unctuous food (incompatible food with contradictory properties) etc, the (vitiated) doshas afflict channels of mind and intellect and abide into heart. The rajas (one of the attributes of the mind) and moha or tamas (another attribute of mind), occlude the person’s self. Excessively aggravated rajas and tamas cover mind and intellect, disturbing the functions of heart, making the person stupid and mentally weak. This leads to improper judgment regarding eternal and ephemeral events and wholesome and unwholesome objects. The expert physicians call this mahagada (grave disease) as atattvabhinivesha. [57- 60]","In the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, the impact of diet and lifestyle on an individual's mental and physical health is profoundly emphasized. According to Sanskrit scholar and author of ""Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing"", Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, when a person consistently consumes impure foods and suppresses natural urges while also indulging in extreme temperatures and contradictory food properties, it can lead to the vitiating of the doshas. These afflicted doshas then invade the channels of the mind and intellect, settling into the heart. The heightened rajas and tamas attributes cloud the self, causing mental weakness and dullness, ultimately leading to improper judgement and what is referred to as ""mahagada"" or a grave disease called ""atattvabhinivesha"". This ancient Ayurvedic concept highlights the importance of a balanced diet and lifestyle in maintaining both physical and mental well-being."
1515,"This (disease) shall be treated with oleation and fomentation therapies followed by purification therapies like therapeutic emesis etc. Then after doing samsarjana krama (observing specific dietary regimen after purification), diet and drinks which are promoters of intellect should be administered. Juice of brahmi mixed with panchagavya ghrita described above (refer to verses 16-17) should be administered. Similarly, other medhya rasayanas (promoters of intellect) like shankhapushpi should be given.  [61- 62]  Friends, sympathizers, preceptors preaching religious sermons, philosophers should inculcate into him knowledge, understanding, patience, memory and the power of meditation. [63]  Following medicines shall be administered:  garlic with oil; shatavari with milk; juice of brahmi with honey; juice or decoction of kushtha with honey; and powder of vacha with honey.[64]","The suggested course of treatment for this ailment involves the use of oleation, fomentation, and purification therapies, followed by a specific dietary regimen. To promote intellect, brahmi juice mixed with panchagavya ghrita and other medhya rasayanas such as shankhapushpi are recommended. Moreover, spiritual and philosophical guidance from mentors and scholars is encouraged to instill knowledge, understanding, patience, memory, and the ability to meditate. In terms of medication, a regimen consisting of garlic with oil, shatavari with milk, brahmi juice with honey, kushtha juice or decoction with honey, and vacha powder with honey is advised."
1516,"If the disease apasmara is resistant to conventional modes of treatment, if it is chronic and if it has acquired a firm footing, then it should be generally treated with the foregoing recipes of rejuvenating drugs. [65]","The ancient Sanskrit text, ""Sushruta Samhita,"" offers a valuable insight for modern medicine in its description of the disease apasmara. If this condition, which may be compared to epilepsy, proves resistant to traditional treatments, becoming chronic and deeply entrenched, the text recommends turning to rejuvenating drugs as a potential solution. These ""foregoing recipes,"" as described in the verse [65], could offer new avenues of exploration for modern medical science in its quest to treat otherwise unmanageable conditions."
1517,"The patient suffering from apasmara and unmada, should be specially protected from water, fire, trees, mountains and uneven places. These may cause instantaneous death of the patient.[66]","In the delicate management of patients with apasmara (epilepsy) and unmada (insanity), great vigilance must be exercised to ensure their protection from seemingly mundane elements. According to ancient Sanskrit texts, contact with water, fire, trees, mountains, and uneven terrain could potentially trigger instantaneous death for these vulnerable individuals. Therefore, it is essential that caregivers and loved ones take extra precautions to maintain a safe environment, minimizing any potential risks associated with these natural elements."
1518,"Etiological factors of epilepsy; the mode of vitiation of doshas; signs and symptoms in general and of different varieties of epilepsy; treatment of different types of epilepsy; and etiology, signs and symptoms of mahagada (grave disease). Thus, in this chapter, the sage has described treatment of apasmara, in brief as well as in detail as above said.[68] Thus, ends the tenth Chapter dealing with the treatment of apasmara in the section on therapeutics of Agnivesha's work as redacted by Charak, and not being available, restored by Dridhabala.  [69]","The ancient Sanskrit text delves into the complexities of a disease called apasmara, which is known as epilepsy in modern medicine. The sage explains the various etiological factors that contribute to the vitiation of doshas or bodily humors, leading to the onset of this condition. The symptoms of epilepsy are described in detail, along with different varieties of the disease. The text also offers treatment methods for these types of epilepsy, providing both an overview and specific details. Furthermore, the sage describes the etiology and signs and symptoms of mahagada, a grave disease. This tenth chapter concludes the discussion on apasmara treatment in Agnivesha's work as redacted by Charak, and restored by Dridhabala."
1519,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Hikka-Shwasa chikitsa""(Management of Hikka (Hiccups) and Shwasa (Dyspnea)). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the vast expanse of Ayurvedic literature, Lord Atreya's teachings have always been a beacon of hope for those seeking natural and holistic remedies. In his profound wisdom, he emphasizes the importance of managing Hikka (hiccups) and Shwasa (dyspnea), two common ailments that can disrupt our daily lives. As we delve into the intricate workings of these conditions, we will unravel time-tested solutions that provide relief, allowing us to maintain balance and well-being in our existence, as outlined in the chapter ""Hikka-Shwasa chikitsa."""
1520,"Agnivesha , an intelligent disciple,  asked his doubt with modest salute of folded hands to Lord Atreya, who has the knowledge about the subject and principles of the Vedas “The diseases are categorized under two categories (samanyaja and nanatmaja) of three dosha (vata, pitta and kapha) aggravated due to three factors (like unwholesome utilization of sense organs (asatmendriyartha samyoga), intellectual errors (pajnaparadha) and advent of maturity of time (parinama)). Which among these diseases is most difficult to cure?” [3-4]","In the ancient texts of Ayurveda, Agnivesha, a bright and eager disciple, approached his teacher, Lord Atreya, with a humble gesture of respect. He sought knowledge about the classification of diseases based on the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - and their aggravating factors such as improper sensory engagement, cognitive mistakes, and the natural course of time. Among these samanyaja and nanatmaja diseases, Agnivesha was particularly interested to learn about the one that posed the greatest challenge to cure."
1521,"After listening to Agnivesha, Lord Punarvasu, the most prudent among the sages was very delighted and made ultimate and conclusive statement. “In fact there are many diseases which can kill a patient. But none of the diseases is as lethal as shwasa and hikka as they can cause immediate death. The person suffering from any other disease can also get eventually  afflicted with enormously painful hikka and shwasa at the time of death.”[3-7]","In the profound presence of Agnivesha, Lord Punarvasu, known for his sagacious wisdom, expressed his immense delight. He went on to make an authoritative declaration that, while many diseases possess the power to end life, none are as swift and deadly as shwasa and hikka, the dreaded pair of respiratory ailments. In fact, other diseases may ultimately claim lives, but it is not uncommon for those afflicted to experience the excruciating symptoms of shwasa and hikka as they approach their final moments, adding great suffering to an already painful ordeal."
1522,"Hikka and shwasa are mainly kapha and vata dominant in nature. They originate at the site of pitta (upper part of stomach). This results in further depletion of dhatu like rasa dhatu situated in heart. Hence generally they are extremely difficult to treat. After getting afflicted with this disease, if one indulges in unwholesome regimens, then disease gets aggravated and results in death just  as from fatal snake venom.  [8-9]","According to ancient Sanskrit texts, Hikka and Shwasa, two difficult-to-treat conditions, are primarily influenced by the doshas of Kapha and Vata and originate near the site of Pitta in the upper portion of the stomach. These ailments cause further depletion of Rasa Dhatu, the essential nutritive fluid located in the heart. As a result, treating these conditions is often challenging. If individuals adopt unwholesome regimens after being afflicted with this disease, it can lead to aggravation and, ultimately, death, similar to the fatal effects of snake venom."
1523,"Five types of hikka and shwasa, based on etiology, signs, symptoms and treatment are being elaborated here, listen to them carefully:  Environmental factors: Dust, smoke and wind, residing in cold place, use of cold water. Regimen:  Lack of exercise, excessive sexual intercourse, excess walking, Diet: Intake of dry food, vishamashana (food in excessive or less quantity at irregular time) Conditions: Accumulation of ama, anaha (constipation associated with flatulence), dryness in the body, excessive depletion (apatarpana), weakness, injury to marmas (vital points), rapid change in exposure to heat and cold, diarrhea, fever, vomiting, rhinitis, kshata (injury), kshaya (wasting), raktapitta (bleeding disorder), udavarta (upward movement of vata), visuchika (enteritis), alasaka (sluggish bowel), pandu (anemia) and intake of poisons can result in hikka and shwasa. Diet: Regular intake of nishpava (beans), masha (black gram), pinyaka (oil cake), tila taila (sesame oil), pishta (cakes and pastry), shaluka (lotus stem), vishtambhi anna (food aggravating vata), vidahi (food causing burning sensations), heavy to digest food, flesh of aquatic and marshy animals, curd, raw milk, abhishyandhi (ingredients leading to obstruction of channels), food aggravating kapha Injury: Injury to throat and chest Others: Various types of vibandha (obstructions)  [10-16]","The ancient medical science of Ayurveda identifies five causes of hikka (hiccups) and shwasa (labored breathing): etiology, regimen, conditions, diet, injury, and others. Environmental factors such as dust, smoke, and wind, or residing in cold places and using cold water can contribute to these conditions. Additionally, lifestyle choices like lack of exercise, excessive sexual intercourse, and overexertion can also lead to hikka and shwasa. Diet plays a crucial role, with certain foods such as beans, black gram, oil cake, and sesame oil being named as potential causes, as well as irregular eating habits and consumption of hard-to-digest or heavy food. Injuries to the throat and chest, obstructions, and ingestion of toxins are other factors that can result in these conditions. It is important to note that accumulation of ama (toxins) and anaha (constipation associated with flatulence), as well as certain medical conditions such as diarrhea, fever, and vomiting, can also contribute to hikka and shwasa."
1524,By the above mentioned etiological factors the vata gets aggravated in the pranavahasrotas ( channels carrying prana) and deranges the kapha situated in the chest region producing lethal blockage of pranavayu and five types of dreadful hikka and shwasa. [17-18],"In accordance with the aforementioned causes, the vata dosha experiences aggravation within the pranavahasrotas, the channels responsible for carrying prana. This disturbance leads to kapha derangement in the chest region, resulting in a dangerous obstruction of pranavayu. Consequently, five varieties of fearsome hiccups (hikka) and breathlessness (shwasa) emerge, posing significant health concerns for the individual."
1525,"Following are the premonitory symptoms of both the diseases:  Heaviness in throat and chest, astringent taste in mouth, and distension of abdomen are the premonitory symptoms of hikka.   Anaha (constipation with flatulence), pain in the flanks, pain in the cardiac region, abnormal movement of pranavayu are the premonitory symptoms of shwasa.[18-20]","The Sanskrit text describes the early signs of two afflictions: hikka and shwasa. In the case of hikka, one may experience a heaviness in the throat and chest, coupled with an astringent taste in the mouth and a distended abdomen. On the other hand, shwasa is preceded by symptoms such as constipation with flatulence, discomfort in the flanks, pain in the cardiac region, and irregularities in the movement of pranavayu. Understanding these premonitory symptoms can aid in early intervention and treatment of these conditions, according to the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda."
1526,"Vishesha samprapti: Vata along with kapha blocks the channels carrying prana, udaka and anna and produces hikka. A List of the signs and symptoms of many types is elaborated further:   Mahahikka: Vata along with kapha affects the throat of an individual whose mamsa dhatu (muscles), strength, prana and agni are depleted. It further produces remarkably loud and resonant hiccups occurring in bouts of two or three constantly. The blockage of pranavaha srotas (channels carrying prana). Vayu along with aggravated kapha obstructs the pranavaha srotas and marma jatharagni resulting in loss of consciousness, stiffness in the body and also obstructs the channels of food and drinks. There is impairment of memory, tears in the eyes and stiffness in the temples and displacement of eyebrows. He suffers from delirium along with obstruction of speech, which does not get relief by any means. Maha hikka is mahamula (deep rooted), mahavega (massive attack), mahashabda (very loud sound), maha bala (very strong). This can lead to death immediately, hence named as mahahikka. [21-26]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, ""Vishesha samprapti"" refers to the specific progression of a disorder. Of particular interest is the condition known as ""mahahikka,"" which manifests as severe and persistent hiccups. This occurs when both vata and aggravated kapha obstruct the pranavaha srotas, or channels carrying prana, and marma jatharagni, leading to a range of symptoms. These may include loss of consciousness, stiffness in the body, impaired memory, tears in the eyes, and stiffness in the temples. The hiccups themselves are described as remarkably loud and occurring in bouts of two or three constantly. This debilitating condition is considered deep-rooted, massive, and characterized by a very loud sound, making it extremely dangerous and potentially fatal."
1527,"Excessive aggravation of kapha and vayu in an aged, emaciated and mentally depressed individual leads to hikka. This hikka is characterised by deep and resonant sound, and affliction of the chest. He yawns, contracts and expands his body, and while respiring he contracts both the flanks making murmuring sounds, and suffers from stiffness and pain. In such a patient the hikka arises from the umbilicus or pakvashaya (intestines) with pain all over the body. During this time his body bends and he suffers from black outs, obstruction in the respiratory tract and loss of strength and unconsciousness. Such hikka is known as gambhira hikka which ultimately results in death. [27-30]","Hikka, a term used in Ayurveda to describe a type of abnormal breathing, can have serious consequences for certain individuals. According to Charaka Samhita, an ancient Indian medical text, hikka that is characterized by a deep and resonant sound, chest affliction, yawning, and body stiffness can occur in elderly, thin, and mentally depressed people who have an excess of kapha and vayu. This type of hikca, known as gambhira hikca, originates from the umbilicus or intestines, causing pain throughout the body, leading to fainting spells, respiratory tract obstruction, loss of consciousness, and ultimately death."
1528,"The vyapeta hikka produced after the intake of four types of food (i.e. eatable, chewable, drinkable, lickable) and gets aggravated after food gets digested. He suffers from delirium, vomiting, diarrhea, thirst and unconsciousness. There is yawning, watering of eyes, dryness of mouth and bending of the body, and adhmana (distension of the abdomen). This hikka originates from the root of the clavicle and attack is not continuous. Hikka is injurious to life. [31-33]","In the ancient Sanskrit text, the term ""vyapeta hikka"" refers to a specific type of hiccup that occurs after the consumption of various types of food - those that are eatable, chewable, drinkable, and lickable. The condition becomes further aggravated once the food gets digested, leading to severe symptoms such as delirium, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme thirst, and even unconsciousness. Other symptoms include yawning, watering of eyes, dryness of mouth, and bending of the body, accompanied by a distension of the abdomen known as adhmana. Interestingly, this type of hiccup is said to originate from the root of the clavicle, and its attacks are not continuous. Most significantly, vyapeta hikka is considered injurious to life, making it a critical medical condition in need of immediate attention and treatment."
1529,"The vayu gets slightly aggravated in the koshtha (alimentary tract), due to the physical exercises and reaches the throat and produces kshudra hikka. This does not produce much pain and does not afflict the head and vital parts (hridaya marma). In this type of hikka, the doshas do not reside or get lodged in the channels of respiration, food and drinks. This gets aggravated on exertion and subsides on taking food. Hikka gets subsided by itself also. The doshas are situated in cardiac region, kloma, throat and palate. This mild form of hikka is curable and known as kshudra hikka. [35-37]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, a mild form of hiccups, known as ""kshudra hikka,"" occurs when the vayu, or air, in the alimentary tract becomes slightly agitated due to physical exertion. This aggravation results in subtle hiccups, which do not cause significant pain or affect the head and vital organs, such as the heart (hridaya marma). Unlike other forms of hiccups, kshudra hikka does not involve the lodging of doshas, or bodily humors, in the respiratory, food, or drink channels. Instead, these doshas reside in the cardiac region, kloma, throat, and palate. This mild form of hiccups tends to escalate with further exertion but typically subsides on its own or after eating. Thanks to its benign nature and lack of complications, kshudra hikka is considered curable in Ayurvedic practice."
1530,"The vayu gets aggravated and moves in the upward direction due to the intake of excess food or drinks in hurry or excess of alcohol, anger, talking, laughing, weightlifting etc. factors aggravate vayu in koshtha (alimentary tract) gets afflicted by food and drinks and move in the upward direction and get lodged in channels of chest and produce annaja hikka. This hikka occurs slowly and intermittently along with sneezing. The hikka that does not afflict vital points (marma) and organs and it subsides after drinking water or taking food is known as annaja hikka.[38-41]","In the ancient science of Ayurveda, it is believed that the balance of bodily humors, or doshas, is essential for optimal health. The vayu, or air, dosha can become aggravated due to a variety of factors, including excessive or hurried food and drink intake, alcohol consumption, anger, and physical exertion such as weightlifting. When this occurs, the digestive system becomes afflicted, causing food and drinks to move in the wrong direction, upward through the alimentary tract, and becoming lodged in the chest's channels. This blockage results in a specific type of hiccup, known as ""annaja hikka,"" which is characterized by slow, intermittent occurrences accompanied by sneezing. However, this type of hiccup does not affect vital points or organs and typically subsides after drinking water or eating food."
1531,"The hikka destroys a person suffering from excessive accumulation of dosha, emaciated due to fasting, emaciated due to disease, weak due to ageing or excessive indulgence in sex. The symptoms of delirium, pain, excess thirst and stupor in yamika hikka patient make it incurable for treatment.   The yamika hikka is curable in an individual who is not emaciated, not weak mentally, the dhatu and indriya are unaffected and performing their normal function. Otherwise in case if body is weak, it is incurable. [42-44]","The Sanskrit verse sheds light on the concept of 'hikka' in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, which refers to a condition of delirium and excess thirst. This ailment is particularly detrimental for those who are already weakened by fasting, illness, or old age, or who have engaged in excessive sexual activity. The symptoms of yamika hikka, including delirium, pain, thirst, and stupor, make it resistant to treatment. However, in individuals who are physically and mentally strong, with healthy bodily tissues and functioning senses, this condition can be cured. Conversely, if the body is too weakened, the hikka remains untreatable."
1532,"The aggravated vayu along with vitiated kapha obstructs the channels (of prana, udaka and annavaha) and spreads throughout the body and produces shwasa. [45]","In the context of health and wellness, it is important to understand the implications of a disturbance in the balance of the body's vital energies. According to Ayurvedic teachings, when vayu (the energy associated with movement) becomes aggravated and combines with vitiated kapha (the energy associated with growth and lubrication), it can lead to an obstruction in the channels through which prana (life force), udaka (water), and annavaha (nutrients) flow. This blockage allows the excess vayu to spread throughout the body, leading to the manifestation of shwasa, or troubled breathing. It is crucial to address this imbalance in order to maintain optimal health and well-being."
1533,"The patient breathes with a loud noise during the night due to the upward movement of aggravated vayu like intoxicated bull. The vayu gets obstructed and the person becomes unconscious. The eyes get distorted and he cannot visualize properly. The eyes and face become abnormal and the elimination of urine and feces is obstructed and the voice becomes feeble and the person looks tired and respiration could be heard from distance, such person suffering from mahashwasa succumbs to death very fast. [46-48]","According to ancient Sanskrit texts, a patient experiencing ""mahashwasa"" faces a rapid decline in health. The condition is characterized by loud, labored nighttime breathing that resembles the stumbling gait of an intoxicated bull. This aggravated vayu, or life force, becomes obstructed and rises upward, leading to unconsciousness and distorted vision. Additionally, the patient's eyes and face become abnormal, urination and defecation are hindered, and their voice grows weak. The respiratory system becomes impaired, with audible breathing from a distance, and the individual appears tired and fatigued. Ultimately, this severe breathing disorder proves fatal at a rapid pace."
1534,"The vitiated kapha obstructs channels of respiration leading to aggravation of vata resulting in prolonged expiration and shallow inspiration (breath doesn’t get deeply inspired). The patient looks up with moving eye balls as if he is scared of something. When he gets afflicted with this type of shwasa he suffers from unconsciousness, dryness of mouth, restlessness. The upward movement of vayu is aggravated resulting in obstruction of downward movement and unconsciousness, black outs and he succumbs to death quickly. [49-51]","In the ancient medical text of Ayurveda, the Samhitas of Charaka, a profound description is given of certain respiratory conditions, known as shwasa. Of particular interest is the type characterized by the obstruction of the channels of respiration due to an excess of kapha dosha, or phlegm. This obstruction leads to a distinctive pattern of breathing, where expiration is prolonged and inspiration is shallow, with the patient's breath unable to reach its full depth. The individual may present with a frightened appearance, their eyes darting about as if they are startled. If this condition progresses, it can result in unconsciousness, dry mouth, and restlessness. Of note, the aggravation of vayu, or wind, is also described, which hampers its downward movement and further contributes to the onset of unconsciousness and ultimately, death."
1535,"The patient suffering from chhinna shwasa has interrupted breath as the prana(vital centers) [Cha. Sa. Sutra Sthana 29]  is afflicted. There is complete stoppage of breath, such individual suffers from intense pain as if cutting of the marma (vital parts), constipation with abdominal distension, sweating, unconsciousness, burning sensation in basti (bladder and urinary system), excessive tears in the eyes, emaciation of the body, the eyes become red when patient struggles to breath, mental disorientation, dryness of mouth, discoloration of skin, delirium, looseness of joints. An individual suffering from above said features of chhinna shwasa succumbs to death very quickly. [52-54]","Chhinna shwasa, a life-threatening condition according to the Charaka Samhita's Sutra Sthana 29, is characterized by an irregular and interrupted breath. This occurs when the prana, or vital centers of the body, become afflicted. The suffering is immense, with patients feeling as if their vital parts are being cut. Accompanying symptoms include constipation, abdominal distension, sweating, and unconsciousness. A burning sensation in the urinary system, excessive tears, emaciation, red eyes, mental disorientation, dry mouth, skin discoloration, delirium, and loose joints are also indicative of this condition. Those who exhibit these symptoms may face rapid onset of death."
1536,"The vayu moves in the opposite direction due to the obstruction in the respiratory tract, stiffness in the neck, head aggravates the kapha and produces rhinorrhoea, and gurghuraka sound (rhonchi). Exceedingly severe attack afflicts the prana and enhances severity. During severe attack, the patient faints repeatedly, has severe cough and becomes unconscious. The patient finds it difficult to expectorate the phlegm and feels relieved for period of 1 muhurta (3 hours) after expectoration of phlegm. There is hoarseness of voice and patient speaks with difficulty, even he does not get proper sleep, and on lying down he suffers from dyspnea as his flanks are afflicted by vayu. He feels comfortable in the sitting position. He likes hot things. His eye balls are always prominent, there is sweat on the forehead, dryness of the mouth, gets repeated attacks of dyspnea, and it increases and subsides repeatedly. In gets aggravated when appearance of clouds in the sky, rains, cold weather, easterly winds and kapha enhancing food and behavior. The tamaka shwasa having above mentioned features is yapya (palliable) and in the initial stages it is curable disease. [55-62]","According to this ancient Sanskrit text, the condition known as tamaka shwasa presents with a series of specific symptoms. When the respiratory tract becomes obstructed, the vayu, or air element, moves in the opposite direction, leading to a characteristic gurghuraka sound. The head and neck become stiff, and the kapha dosha is aggravated, resulting in a runny nose. The patient experiences severe coughing fits, sometimes even losing consciousness. Hoarseness of voice and difficulty speaking are also common. Sleep is often disturbed, and dyspnea is exacerbated when lying down. Relief comes in the form of expectorating phlegm every three hours. External factors such as cloudy skies, rain, cold weather, easterly winds, and kapha-enhancing foods and behaviors can aggravate the condition. However, with proper care and attention, this early stage of tamaka shwasa is considered curable and palliable."
1537,"In a patient of tamaka shwasa if jwara (fever) and unconsciousness are occurring as complication, then it is called as pratamaka shwasa. The shwasa produced due to udavarta (upward movement of vayu in koshtha), dust, indigestion, excessive liquid accumulation in the body (klinna kaya), and suppression of natural urges results in increase of tama. This gets relieved by following of cooling regimen. The person suffering from this shwasa feels as if he is submerged in darkness, thus it is known as santamaka.[63-64]","Tamaka shwasa, a respiratory disorder, can be complicated by the onset of fever and unconsciousness, a condition known as pratamaka shwasa. This can result from various factors such as udavarta, dust, indigestion, excessive fluid accumulation, and suppressed urges, all of which contribute to an increase in the tama guna. The Yogic philosophy of Sankhya describes three gunas or qualities that make up universal matter - sattva, rajas, and tamas. Tamas is associated with darkness, ignorance, and inertia. In the context of pratamaka shwasa, the person afflicted feels as if they are submerged in darkness, giving this condition its name, santamaka. Cooling regimens have been found to provide relief from symptoms, highlighting the importance of a balanced and holistic approach to managing this respiratory disorder."
1538,"Due to intake of dry food and exertion, vata is mildly vitiated in koshtha and moves in the upward direction i.e respiratory tract resulting in kshudra shwasa. The patient suffering from this type of shwasa does not have any affliction of various body parts and the functions are not affected. It is not very painful as it does not affect the channels of food and drinks nor does it cause pain to the sense organs. This is curable if the symptom is not completely manifested and the patient is strong. Thus all the types of hikka and shwasa are elaborated along with their signs and symptoms.[65-67]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, a Sanskrit verse describes the condition known as ""kshudra shwasa,"" which is caused by the mild aggravation of vata in the lower digestive tract due to the consumption of dry food and exertion. This aggravated vata moves upward, affecting the respiratory tract. Despite this disturbance, the individual does not experience afflictions in various body parts or any significant impairment of their functions. The discomfort is relatively minor, as it neither affects the channels of food and drinks nor causes pain to the sense organs. Fortunately, if addressed before fully manifesting and when the patient is strong, this type of shwasa can be treated successfully. This verse provides a comprehensive overview of different types of hikka (hiccups) and shwasa (breathing difficulties), along with their associated signs and symptoms."
1539,"Among them the fatal varieties (like maha hikka, gambhira hikka, vyapeta hikka, maha shwasa, urdhva shwasa, chhinna shwasa are incurable types) should not be treated. While the curable and controllable variety of hikka and shwasa should be treated with medicine quickly. If neglected then it destroys the prana of the patient as the fire burns away the dry grass very fast.[68-69]","In the ancient medical text, it is advised that certain incurable forms of hikka (hiccups) and shwasa (breathing difficulties) such as maha hikka, gambhira hikka, vyapeta hikka, maha shwasa, urdhva shwasa, and chhinna shwasa should not be attempted to treat. On the other hand, those varieties that are curable and manageable through medical intervention should be treated promptly. Neglecting these conditions can have severe consequences, as they can quickly deteriorate and cause harm to the prana (vital energy) of the patient, much like how a fire consumes dry grass in no time."
1540,"The etiological factors, site, origin of both hikka and shwasa are same and hence the treatment is also same. Kindly listen attentively the treatment of hikka and shwasa as known by the seers.   Initially the patient suffering from hikka and shwasa should be treated with massage with combination of rock salt and sesame oil over the chest region followed by administration of unctuous sudation by means of nadi sveda or prastara sveda or sankara sveda. By this the clogged kapha gets liquefied in the channels and the channels become soft and vata moves in the downward direction (vatanulomana). As the ice on the top of the mountain gets liquefied by the rays of the sun, the kapha accumulated in the srotas get liquefied by swedana.  After the administration snehana (oleation) and swedana (sudation), one has to give rice along with unctuous substances. The meat soup prepared from fish or pig or curds in large quantity should be taken in meals. When the kapha gets aggravated due to above mentioned means vamana (emesis therapy) should be administrated with powder of pippali (piper longum Linn), saindhava (rock salt) and honey. While selection of the drugs care should be taken not to administer the vata aggravating drugs. After the expulsion of vitiated kapha the patient feels relieved as the vata gets alleviated and moves in the normal direction as obstructed srotas are cleared. [70-76]","The Sanskrit verse reveals that the root causes, location, and onset of both hikka (hiccups) and shwasa (breathing difficulties) are identical, leading to similar treatment approaches. Ancient seers have recommended a consistent regimen to treat these conditions, starting with a massage using a rock salt and sesame oil mixture on the patient's chest. This is followed by three types of sudation therapies: nadi sveda, prastara sveda, or sankara sveda, which help melt clogged kapha in the channels and soften them, encouraging vata to move downwards.

These initial steps are similar to how the sun melts the ice on a mountain's peak; here, swedana helps liquefy accumulated kapha within the srotas (body channels). Post-oleation (snehana) and sudation (swedana), a diet of rice with unctuous substances should be introduced. Consuming large quantities of fish, pig, or curds soup is encouraged during meals.

Should an aggravation of kapha occur due to the above methods, vamana (emesis therapy) must be administered using pippali (long pepper), saindhava (rock salt), and honey in a powdered form. The choice of medication should carefully avoid increasing vata aggravation. Once vitiated kapha is expelled from the body through this treatment, the patient experiences relief as vata alleviates and normalizes its direction, with cleared obstructed srotas."
1541,"The dosha remaining after the administration of vamana treatment should be expelled by means of dhuma (medicated smoking). The haridra (turmeric), roots of eranda (Ricinus communis Linn), laksha (Ficus Lacor Buch-Ham), manahshila (realgar, an Arsenic compound), jatamansi (Nardostachys jatamansone BC), are powdered properly and wick is prepared. This wick is smeared with ghee and used for medicated smoking.  The barley should be mixed with ghee and used for smoking.   The bee wax, rala (exudate of Shorea robusta Gaertn.) and ghee are kept in inside two mud plates (mallaka samputa). The smoke coming out of it after application of heat should be inhaled for smoking.   Cow’s horn, hair, ligaments are mixed and used for smoking by putting it in dhuma netra. Shyonaka, roots of eranda (Ricinis communis Linn) and kusha (Desmostachya bipinnata Stapf.) should be filled with above mentioned drugs and used as a pipe for smoking. Padmaka (Prunus puddum), guggulu (Commiphora mukul (Hook ex Stocks), agaru (Aquallaria agollacha Roxb) and shallaki (Boswellia serrata Roxb.) are powdered and mixed with ghee and used for smoking. [77-80]","After the Vamana treatment, it is crucial to expel any remaining dosha through medicated smoking or Dhuma. A variety of substances are used in this process, including turmeric, Ricinus communis Linn roots, Ficus Lacor Buch-Ham, realgar, Nardostachys jatamansone BC, and ghee, which are powdered and used to prepare a wick. This wick is then smeared with ghee and utilized for smoking. Additionally, barley mixed with ghee is also used for smoking. Another method involves the use of beeswax, exudate of Shorea robusta Gaertn., and ghee, placed inside two mud plates and heated to produce smoke for inhalation. Furthermore, a pipe made from Cow's horn, hair, ligaments, Shyonaka, Ricinis communis Linn roots, and Kusha grass is filled with the above-mentioned drugs for smoking. Lastly, a mixture of Prunus puddum, Commiphora mukul (Hook ex Stocks), Aquallaria agollacha Roxb., and Boswellia serrata Roxb., powdered and mixed with ghee, is used for smoking."
1542,"The hikka and shwasa patient accompanied with complications like feeble voice, diarrhea, raktapitta (bleeding disorder) should be treated with medicines having properties of sweet, unctuous, and cold. [81]","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, ancient texts offer valuable insights for treating specific health conditions. For a patient experiencing hikka (a spasmodic condition) and shwasa (difficulty in breathing) with additional complications such as a feeble voice, diarrhea, and raktapitta (a bleeding disorder), Ayurveda recommends a particular therapeutic approach. Medicines with sweet, unctuous, and cold properties should be administered to manage these symptoms and alleviate the patient's discomfort, as outlined in verse [81] of this revered text. This holistic guidance emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment in Ayurveda, considering the unique needs and ailments of each individual."
1543,"The patient of shwasa and hikka suffering from burning sensation, bleeding, and excessive sweating, depleted dhatu, loss of strength, dryness, and associated with condition of pregnancy or having pitta Prakriti should not be administered swedana(sudation).  In such condition, if it is very essential then mild sudation should be given over chest and throat region for short duration, in the form of parisheka with warm oil or application of warm utkarika (a kind of poultice) mixed with sugar or upanaha(poultice).  Utkarika is prepared with powders of sesame, black gram and wheat are mixed with vatahara sneha and gruel and swedana is done or warm gruel and milk are used for swedana in the form of parisheka.  The patient suffering from fever of recent origin and ama dosha should be treated with ruksha sweda and langhana. Or vamana (emesis) should be induced by administering saindhavalavana (rock salt) and water.   Meal should be taken along with vata alleviating meat soups etc. in condition of aggravation of vata due to excessive vamana. Alleviation of vata should also be done by massage with vatahara drugs which are not cold, nor hot in property.  [82-87]","In the delicate condition of a patient suffering from both shwasa and hikka, accompanied by distressing symptoms such as burning sensations, bleeding, and excessive sweating, it is highly advised to refrain from swedana or sudation treatments. However, in rare cases where it becomes necessary, mild sudation should be carefully administered over the chest and throat region, using warm oil or a poultice mixed with sugar. Practitioners may opt for utkarika, prepared with sesame, black gram, and wheat powders blended with vatahara sneha and gruel. Alternatively, they can use a warm mixture of gruel and milk for parisheka. For patients experiencing fever and ama dosha, ruksha sweda and langhana are recommended, or vamana (emesis) can be induced using saindhavalavana (rock salt) and water. Following excessive vamana, it is essential to consume vata-alleviating meat soups to stabilize the system. Additionally, massage with moderately warm vatahara drugs can help further alleviate vata aggravation in the body [82-87]."
1544,"The patients suffering from hikka and shwasa are of two types i.e. one having strength and other weak. One has aggravation of kapha and other having dryness and vata predominance.   Management of patient having strength: The patient of hikka and shwasa having kapha predominance and strength should be treated with therapeutic emesis and purgation along with wholesome food and regimen. Further alleviation should be done with medicated smoking and administration of lehya etc.    Management of weak patient:The patient having aggravation of vata and weakness, children and elderly hikka, shwasa patients should be managed with vata alleviating medicines and nourishing sneha, soups, and meat soup. [88-90]","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, patients suffering from hikka (hiccups) and shwasa (breathing difficulties) are categorized into two groups – those with strength and those who are weak. For those who possess strength and have an excess of kapha, a combination of therapeutic emesis, purgation, wholesome food, and regimen is recommended. Further alleviation can be achieved through medicated smoking and the administration of lehya (a type of Ayurvedic medicine). Conversely, for patients who are weak and have an aggravation of vata, management should focus on vata-alleviating medicines, nourishing sneha (oils), soups, and meat soup. This individualized approach to treatment is at the heart of Ayurvedic medicine and its aim to restore balance to the body and mind."
1545,"If purification therapy is administered in the hikka shwasa patients without aggravation of kapha, in patients contraindicated for swedana or in very weak patients, then the aggravated vayu afflicts marma (vital points) and results in death instantaneously.   Brimhana therapy in hikka shwasa: Strong and sturdy patient with aggravated kapha should be administered with meat soup prepared from aquatic and marshy animals followed by swedana and vamana. Weak patient without aggravation of kapha should be administered brimhana (nourishment therapy). [91-93]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, the ancient Sanskrit verse highlights the potential dangers of improper administration of purification therapy for specific patient profiles. For instance, patients suffering from hikka shwasa (a type of respiratory disorder) who also have an imbalance in kapha should not undergo swedana (sudation) and must be carefully monitored during treatment to avoid fatal consequences. Conversely, brimhana therapy, which involves nourishment treatments, is recommended for weak patients without kapha aggravation, while strong patients with excess kapha should consume meat soups from aquatic animals before undergoing sudation and emesis therapies. The precision and customization of these treatments underscore the complexity and sophistication of Ayurvedic medicine."

Matulungadi yusha: Leaves of matulunga (Citrus medica Linn.), nimba (Azadirachta indica A. Juss), kulaka are taken in equal quantity and mixed with mudga (green gram) and cooked in water as yusha. Further trikatu powder (maricha-Piper nigrum Linn, pippali- Piper longum linn. and shunthi-Zingiber officinale Roxb.) should be added at the time drinking in hikka shwasa patients.   Mudga yusha: Rock salt, yavakshara, seeds of drum stick and maricha (pepper) powder should be added to the already prepared mudga yusha and consumed in hikka shwasa patients.   Yusha prepared from leaves of kasamarda (Senna occidentalis Linn), shobhanjana (drum stick- Moringa oleifera Lam.), and dry radish should also be given in hikka shwasa.   The yusha prepared from juice or decoction of brihati (Solanum indica Linn.) should be mixed with ghee, curd, maricha, pippali and shunthi is conducive in hikka and shwasa disease.

[94-104]","The ancient Indian practice of preparing medicinal decoctions, known as Yushas, has been used for centuries to treat various ailments, including hikka shwasa or chronic hiccough and dyspnea. These Yushas are prepared using a variety of herbs, fruits, and grains, each with their own unique medicinal properties. For instance, the Nidigdhikadi Yusha utilizes the anti-inflammatory properties of Solanum surattense Burm. f (Nidigdhika) and the expectorant qualities of Tribulus terrestris Linn. (Trikanthaka). Similarly, the Rasnadi Yusha combines the antispasmodic effects of Pluchea lanceolata C B Clarke (Rasna) with the bronchodilator properties of Zingiber officinale Roxb. (Shunthi). These Yushas, when consumed with spices like Piper longum Linn. (Pippali) and rock salt (Saindhava lavana), are believed to provide relief to patients suffering from hikka shwasa."
1547,Drinks in hikka shwasa patients: The patient suffering from hikka shwasa should drink water prepared in dashamula or devadaru (Cedrus deodara (Roxb.) Loud.) or madira (variety of alcohol) on feeling thirst.  ,"In the context of managing hikka shwasa, an ancient Sanskrit text recommends that patients drink specific types of beverages upon experiencing thirst. The three suggested drinks include water boiled with dashamula, a decoction made from cedrus deodara (devadaru), and a type of alcoholic beverage known as madira. These remedies are prescribed to alleviate the symptoms of hikka shwasa, a medical condition characterized by irregular and spasmodic breathing. While alcohol is not typically recommended as a treatment for modern-day respiratory ailments, it is essential to approach ancient medical texts with an understanding of their historical and cultural contexts."

Alkali prepared stalk of feather of peacock, alkali of quills of fish, hair of shashvita, alkali of bones of jandaka, chasha, or kurara, skin, bones and hooves of shringi, ekashapha, dvishapha etc. animals are burnt into ash separately and alkali is prepared. This powder administered with honey and ghee results in cure of kasa (cough), hikka (hiccups) and shwasa (dyspnea).  Above said kshara lehya (Alkaline linctus) clear the kapha in the obstructed respiratory tract and subsides the aggravated pranavayu. Hence the alkaline linctus should be given to purify the channels obstructed by kapha if there is no obstruction by kapha it should not be administered. [105-120]","The Sanskrit verse describes various Ayurvedic remedies for alleviating different types of breathing ailments such as hikka shwasa, or hiccups.

This mixture is taken with hot water. These ancient Ayurvedic remedies offer a holistic approach to treating respiratory ailments, focusing on balancing the body's doshas and restoring harmony to the system."
1550,"An intelligent doctor in shwasa associated with cough and hoarseness of voice should be administered vamana and in tamaka shwasa virechana should be given with vata-kaphahara medicines.   If the path of flowing water is blocked the enhancing pressure of water breaks the dam similarly the path obstructed by kapha aggravates vata and causes harm, hence always the path of vayu should be cleaned by means of purification. [121-122]","In managing respiratory disorders like shwasa, associated with cough and hoarseness, it is crucial for doctors to administer appropriate treatments. For instance, if a patient with an intelligent mind experiences symptoms of shwasa related to phlegm (kapha), the doctor should consider performing vamana (therapeutic emesis) using kapha-reducing medicines. On the other hand, in tamaka shwasa, where the airways are constricted due to an imbalance in vata, doctors can administer virechana (purgation) with vata-reducing drugs. This is because when the natural flow of water (representing dhatus or body fluids) is obstructed, the pressure increases and may break the obstruction; similar consequences occur when kapha blocks the path of vayu (air), leading to aggravation of vata and subsequent damage. Therefore, it's essential for healthcare professionals to maintain cleanliness in the patient's body by regularly performing purification treatments, ensuring a harmonious balance between bodily fluids and air elements."

The supernatant part of ghee mixed with saindhava lavana or juice of alaktaka along with bees’ feces or human milk should be given in the form of nasya. Medicated ghee prepared from madhura varga should be given orally or in the form of nasya pacifies hikka and shwasa very quickly. Alternate oral consumption of hot and cold milk or usage in the form of nasya alleviates hikka quickly.

As per the text, it is recommended to consume this prepared ghee with honey or a mixture of trishna (maricha, pippali, shunthi) or dadhika ghrita or vasa ghrita for treating conditions like hikka and shwasa."
1559,"The food, drinks and drugs having kapha-vatahara and ushna (hot) property which facilitate the normal movement of vata (vatanulomana) should be given in the patient of hikka and shwasa.  ","In the treatment of respiratory disorders such as hiccups and shortness of breath, it is recommended to consume foods, drinks, and medications that possess the qualities of reducing kapha and vata doshas while also having a hot property that promotes the normal flow of vata. These remedies work by alleviating the root causes of these conditions, making them an effective choice for managing symptoms and promoting overall respiratory health."
1560,Hikka shwasa treatment based on dosha: The medicines or food that aggravate vata and destroy kapha or aggravate kapha and alleviate vata must never be used in the treatment.   However drugs that alleviate vata and aggravate kapha can be used in exceptional conditions.   Brimhana(nourishment therapy) administered in hikka and shwasa and its complications make them curable. The shamana treatment (palliative therapy) prevents the complications. Karshana (depletion therapy) makes hikka and shwasa incurable.   ,"In the traditional medical system of Ayurveda, the treatment for respiratory disorders like hikka (hiccups) and shwasa (asthma) is carefully tailored to each individual's dosha, or constitutional type. Medicines or foods that increase vata while decreasing kapha should be avoided, as should those that have the opposite effect. However, in certain exceptional cases, medications that reduce vata while increasing kapha may be used. The administration of brimhana (nourishment therapy) can help to cure these conditions, while shamana (palliative therapy) can prevent complications. On the other hand, karshana (depletion therapy) can make hikka and shwasa incurable. As such, it is essential to seek out the guidance of a knowledgeable Ayurvedic practitioner in order to ensure that treatment is both safe and effective."
1561,Hence shamana (palliative) and brimhana (nourishment) therapy should be done in hikka and shwasa with or without purification of the body. [147-150],"In the context of managing hikka (a type of breathing disorder) and shwasa (another form of respiratory issue), Ayurvedic practitioners recommend a twofold approach, encompassing both shamana (palliative) and brimhana (nourishment) therapies. These treatments can be administered with or without the prior purification of the body, providing Ayurvedic physicians with a flexible and holistic approach to address respiratory disorders. This balanced methodology is discussed in verses 147-150 of the ancient Ayurvedic text, emphasizing the importance of tailoring treatments to individual needs while preserving the integrity of the overall therapeutic process."
1562,"In the chapter of hikka and shwasa the reason for explaining them together, their similarity in causes, treatment, the features and pathyas are explained. Thus in the treatise by Agnivesha, redacted by Charaka and completed by Dridhabala, this concludes the chapter entitled Hikka Shwasa Chikitsa.","In the ancient text of Ayurvedic medicine, Agnivesha's treatise, as revised by Charaka and finalized by Dridhabala, the chapter of Hikka and Shwasa provides valuable insights into these respiratory conditions. According to this chapter, these ailments are explained together due to their shared causes and similar symptoms, which require comparable treatment approaches. The features of Hikka (hiccups) and Shwasa (dyspnea or labored breathing) are carefully examined, and the pathyas (regimen) for managing them are detailed in this chapter, titled Hikka Shwasa Chikitsa, concluding the exploration of these respiratory disorders."
1563,"Now we shall expound the chapter ""Raktapitta Chikitsa""(Management of bleeding disorders). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2]","In the vast tapestry of Ayurvedic wisdom, the thread of bleeding disorder management holds a significant place. Known as ""Raktapitta Chikitsa,"" this chapter is a testament to Lord Atreya's profound understanding and compassionate intent to alleviate suffering. As we delve into its verses, we unravel time-honored insights on identifying, treating, and preventing these disorders, providing a beacon of hope for those seeking holistic healing."
1564,"Agnivesha bowed to Punarvasu Atreya who is devoid of confusion, having fire-like brilliance(sharp intellect) and self-control while he was making stroll in the panchaganga region, and said, “O Lord! the etiology along with symptoms of haemorrhagic disorders has already been said, now you may tell me the further points, O my teacher! [3-4]","In the picturesque panchaganga region, where five rivers flow and create a harmonious blend of nature's beauty, Agnivesha, a dedicated student, came across his revered teacher, Punarvasu Atreya. Known for his fiery brilliance and self-control, Atreya was like a beacon of light, guiding his students through the complexities of medical science. As Atreya strolled along the riverbanks, Agnivesha bowed with respect and admiration, acknowledging his teacher's profound understanding of haemorrhagic disorders. Having already discussed the etiology and symptoms, Agnivesha humbly requested Atreya to share further insights, continuing their journey of learning and discovery together."
1565,"The teacher said-    The physician knowing causes and symptoms should quickly manage the case of haemorrhagic disorders which is an acute dreadful disease, having more severity and quick-acting like fire. The etiology of the same has already been said earlier such as intake of hot, sharp, sour, pungent and salty substances in excess, exposure to the sun and foods that cause burning sensations. [5-6]","In the teachings of medical wisdom, the physician is guided to promptly address haemorrhagic disorders, as these acute diseases possess a dreadful severity that strikes with the swiftness of fire. The root causes and symptoms of such afflictions have been previously explained, stemming from an excess of hot, sharp, sour, pungent, and salty substances, overexposure to the sun, and dietary choices that induce burning sensations within the body. Recognizing these etiologies is crucial for the physician to effectively manage and treat this urgent medical condition, as stated by the teacher."
1566,"Pitta aggravated by these causes vitiates rakta. Due to similarity in constitution (of rakta and pitta), the pathogenesis develops furthermore to vitiate rakta. Due to heat of pitta, the fluid portion from all the fomented dhatus oozes out, which additionally leads to aggravation of rakta and pitta. [7-8]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, an imbalance in the Pitta dosha can have significant consequences for the body. When Pitta is aggravated, it can negatively affect the Rakta (blood) due to their similar constitution. This initial vitiation then leads to a vicious cycle, where the heat of Pitta causes fluids from other affected Dhatus to leak out, further exacerbating both Pitta and Rakta imbalances in the body. Understanding this pathogenesis is crucial for identifying the root cause of various health issues and devising appropriate Ayurvedic treatment strategies."
1567,"Because of conjunction with, similarity in causes of vitiation, odor, color and origin, the disease is called rakta-pitta. [9]","Rakta-pitta, a disease that affects the body's equilibrium, is so named because of the critical factors that contribute to its development. This condition is characterized by a shared origin with other afflictions, similar causes of impairment, a distinctive odor, and a notable coloration. The convergence of these factors makes rakta-pitta a distinct and readily identifiable disorder within the ancient medical system of Ayurveda."
1568,"The pitta (raktapitta) stays located in spleen and liver, because in persons the blood vessels originate from them. [10]","In the study of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, the concept of doshas is a fundamental principle. One of these doshas, Pitta, is believed to be located in the spleen and liver. This is because, according to Ayurvedic texts, blood vessels originate from these organs, making them central to the functioning of the Pitta dosha. More specifically, the subdosha known as Raktapitta, which governs the blood and its circulation, is closely associated with the spleen and liver. This knowledge has implications for understanding various physiological processes and addressing imbalances in the body."
1569,"Viscous, pale, unctuous and slimy (in blood coming out) indicates affliction by kapha. Blackish, reddish, frothy, thin and roughness in blood indicates affliction by vata. That having ochre-like, black, cow-urine-like, shining black, smoky and collerium-like color indicates pitta affliction. Due to combination of two doshas the symptoms of the concerned ones are combined. Raktapitta caused by sannipata has symptoms of all the three doshas. [11-12]","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, the color and consistency of bodily fluids can provide valuable insights into an individual's health. For instance, if blood is viscous, pale, unctuous, and slimy, with a tendency to be sticky, it may indicate an affliction by kapha dosha. On the other hand, blood that appears blackish or reddish, is frothy, thin, and rough in texture could suggest an imbalance of vata dosha. Meanwhile, blood that has an ochre-like, black, cow-urine-like, shining black, or smoky color may point to pitta dosha affliction. In cases where two doshas are involved, the symptoms may present as a combination of both. Raktapitta caused by sannipata, a condition characterized by the simultaneous involvement of all three doshas, will have symptoms that reflect this complex interplay."
1570,"Raktapitta associated with one dosha is curable; that with two doshas is palliable while that caused by three doshas is incurable. It is also incurable if it is severely forceful and invading the person who has poor digestion, is emaciated due to diseases, old and under-nourished. [13-14]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, Raktapitta, or bleeding disorders, can be treated effectively if only one dosha, or bodily humor, is involved. If two doshas are at play, the condition becomes more challenging to cure but still manageable with proper treatment. However, when all three doshas contribute to Raktapitta, it becomes a formidable and often incurable illness. Furthermore, if the affected individual has poor digestion, is debilitated by other diseases, is advanced in age, or is malnourished, even a Raktapitta caused by a single dosha may become intractable and resistant to treatment."
1571,"Movement of raktapitta is directed upwards and downwards, the former through seven orifices and the latter through two orifices. ","In the context of Ayurveda, raktapitta, a disorder characterized by abnormal upward and downward movement of blood, follows specific pathways in the body. The upward motion occurs through seven distinct orifices, while the downward flow is restricted to two particular openings. Understanding these unique movements of raktapitta is crucial for its effective diagnosis and treatment in Ayurvedic medicine."
1572,"There are seven orifices in head and two below. That coming from upper passages is curable, the one coming downwards is palliable and that which comes both ways is incurable. ","In the human body, as described in ancient Sanskrit texts, there exist nine orifices, seven located on the head and two more near the lower part of the body. The ailments originating from the upper passages are said to be curable, while those arising from the lower openings are considered palliable. However, the conditions that involve both the upper and lower pathways are believed to be incurable, highlighting the severity of such maladies according to these ancient medical scripts."
1573,When it flows out from all the orifices including the hair follicles it is known as with innumerable movements which is fatal.  ,"In the context of ancient Sanskrit texts, the ominous description of a force so powerful that when it streams out from every pore and orifice, even including hair follices, is revealed. This terrifying phenomenon, known as ""ananta-vritti"", literally meaning ""with innumerable movements"", is said to be fatal and indicative of grave circumstances. Its profound implications are woven into the intricate tapestry of Indian spirituality and philosophical thought, offering a glimpse into the culture's deep reverence for the mysteries of life and death."
1574,"Raktapitta passing out excessively through both the passages, having corpselike smell, exceedingly red or black, associated with kapha and vata, adhering in throat, having all the complications mentioned earlier, possessing deep yellow, blue, green or coppery color and is in emaciated and coughing patient is incurable.  ","In the ancient medical text of Sanskrit, a dire prognosis is presented for those suffering from a specific condition called Raktapitta. The symptoms include excessive bleeding through both passages with a strong corpse-like odor, abnormally red or black in color, and associated with kapha and vata imbalances. If the blood adheres to the throat and is accompanied by complications such as emaciation and coughing, and displays uncommon colors like deep yellow, blue, green, or coppery hues, the verse declares the condition incurable. This profound and ancient knowledge underscores the significance of recognizing and addressing early warning signs in medical conditions, even in modern times."
1575,"That raktapitta is palliable which is associated with two doshas, which aggravates again and again after subsiding and shifts from one passage to another. [15-21]","Raktapitta, a condition characterized by bleeding, can be managed if it is caused by the aggravation of two doshas, according to Ayurvedic texts. This condition tends to fluctuate, improving and worsening again over time. Additionally, raktapitta is considered palliable when the site of the bleed shifts from one place to another in the body, making it a complex yet potentially manageable disorder. Proper understanding and management of the doshas and other underlying factors are crucial in addressing this ailment."
1576,"Raktapitta which has only one passage, is in the strong person, not very forceful, with recent onset, in favorable season (early winter and winter) and without complication is curable. [22]","According to Ayurvedic texts, the ailment of Raktapitta presenting with a single passage is curable, particularly in those who are strong and have recently experienced its onset. The condition is not overly aggressive, making it more manageable. Furthermore, individuals diagnosed during favorable seasons, such as early winter and winter, have a higher chance of recovery. However, the absence of complications remains a critical factor in determining the prognosis of this condition. With timely medical intervention and adherence to recommended treatment regimens, Raktapitta can be effectively managed and overcome."
1577,"Raktapitta is caused by food having predominantly unctuous-hot and rough-hot properties. The former often gives rise to the upward movement and the latter to the downward movement of raktapitta. The upward movement in raktapitta is associated with kapha, the downward one with vata and that from both the passages is associated with both kapha and vata. [23-24]","In the ancient medical text of Sanskrit, Charaka Samhita, the cause of a specific disorder called Raktapitta is explained. The disorder, characterized by bleeding from different parts of the body, is said to be caused by the consumption of food that has predominantly unctuous-hot and rough-hot properties. These properties are believed to create imbalances in the doshas or bodily humor, leading to the disorder. The unctuous-hot property often results in upward movement of Raktapitta, while the rough-hot property leads to its downward movement. Furthermore, the movement from both passages is associated with an imbalance of both Kapha and Vata doshas."
1578,"Stambhana (styptic therapy) should not be given at first in hemorrhagic disorders having excessive impurities, aggravated doshas and in a person who is not emaciated and weak and originated from excess nourishment. If checked at the very start, it produces throat congestion, fetid smell from the nose, fainting, anorexia, fever, gulma, spleen enlargement, hardness of bowels, leucoderma, dysuria, skin disorders, piles, erysipelas, loss of complexion, fistula-in-ano, obstruction to intellect and senses.   Hence for successful management, one should at first ignore (should not give styptic therapy) the hemorrhagic disorder after assessing the strength and condition or morbidity in a strong patient. [25-28]","Stambhana, or styptic therapy, is a traditional Ayurvedic treatment that is used to stem bleeding. However, it is not always the best course of action for hemorrhagic disorders. In cases where there are excessive impurities and aggravated doshas, and the patient is not emaciated or weak due to excess nourishment, Stambhana should be avoided at the outset. Attempting to stop the bleeding in these instances can lead to a host of negative side effects, including throat congestion, fetid smells, fainting, anorexia, fever, gulma, spleen enlargement, hardened bowels, leucoderma, dysuria, skin disorders, piles, erysipelas, loss of complexion, fistula-in-ano, and obstruction to the intellect and senses. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully assess a patient's strength and condition before deciding on the best course of treatment. In some cases, it may be necessary to initially ignore the hemorrhagic disorder and focus on addressing the underlying imbalances in the body."
1579,"Mostly the raktapitta is aggravated by amadosha, hence patient should be managed with lightening measures. The physician should apply in the beginning of raktapitta, lightening or nourishing measure according to passage, association of dosha and etiology. [29-30]","In the context of managing raktapitta, a disorder characterized by abnormal bleeding, it is crucial to understand the role of amadosha, or impaired bodily humors, which is often the primary cause behind its aggravation. As outlined in the verse, the approach to treating raktapitta should be tailored to the individual patient's needs, taking into consideration factors such as the passage, association, and etiology of the dosha, or bodily humor, involved. In the initial stages, lightening measures are generally recommended to help alleviate symptoms and promote healing. However, in some cases, nourishing measures may also be necessary. The key is to strike a balance between these two approaches, guided by a thorough understanding of each patient's unique circumstances."
1580,"The patient who feels thirsty should be given water boiled with hribera, chandana, ushira, musta and parpataka or only cooled boiled water. ","In the healing arts, ancient Sanskrit texts offer valuable insights that have stood the test of time. One such recommendation speaks to the care of a patient experiencing thirst. The remedy? Water treated with a blend of herbs, including hribera, chandana, ushira, musta, and parpataka. As an alternative, cooled boiled water also provides soothing relief. These timeless teachings underscore the holistic approach to wellness embraced by ancient cultures, offering wisdom that remains relevant to our understanding of health and healing today."
1581,"One having knowledge of constitution and preparation should prescribe saturating drink in upward movement of raktapitta and liquid gruel in the downward one considering time, suitability and association of doshas. For saturation, water boiled with kharjura (date), mridvika (fruit), madhuka (dry flowers) and parushaka (fruit) and cooled along with sugar.    ","In the context of raktapitta, a condition characterized by abnormal upward and downward movement of blood, the role of a knowledgeable physician becomes crucial. They must be well-versed in the constitution and preparation of medicines to prescribe appropriate treatments. During the upward flow of raktapitta, a saturating drink is recommended, while during its downward movement, liquid gruel is considered more suitable. The prescription should consider factors like time, patient's suitability, and dosha association. A concoction prepared with boiled date (kharjura), fruit (mridvika), dry flowers of madhuka, parushaka fruit, sugar, and cooled water serves as an effective saturating agent in the management of raktapitta."
1582,"Powder of parched paddy mixed with ghee and honey makes a good saturating preparation which, if taken timely, alleviates the upward movement of raktapitta. The saturating preparation may be soured with pomegranates and amalaka fruits in persons having poor digestion and suited to sour things.[31-35]","In Ayurvedic medicine, a highly beneficial preparation exists for addressing the symptoms of raktapitta, a condition characterized by an upward movement of blood in the body. This remedy consists of parched paddy powder blended with ghee and honey, creating a potent saturating concoction. Timely consumption of this mixture can provide much-needed relief for those suffering from raktapitta. Furthermore, individuals with weak digestion or a preference for sour foods may find additional benefits in souring the preparation with pomegranates and amalaka fruits, enhancing its overall effectiveness."
1583,"The patients of raktapitta should take meal consisting of the cereals of shali, shashtika, nivara, koradusha, prashantika, shyamaka and priyangu. ","In the treatment of raktapitta, a disorder characterized by bleeding from various parts of the body, great importance is given to diet. The Sharpankara Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text, recommends that patients with raktapitta consume a meal primarily made up of specific cereals. These cereals include shali, shashtika, nivara, koradusha, prashantika, shyamaka, and priyangu. Each of these grains has unique medicinal properties that help to balance the doshas and promote healing in the body. By following this dietary recommendation, patients can support their treatment and potentially speed up their recovery process."
1584,"For them gram, lentils, green grams, makustha (kidney beans), and adhaki are recommended for the pulse-soup. ","In the ancient Sanskrit texts, specific dietary recommendations were made for maintaining optimal health. For those seeking to enhance their digestive wellbeing, a pulse-soup recipe was suggested. The ingredients included gram (chickpeas), lentils, green grams, makustha (kidney beans), and adhaki (black gram). These legumes were believed to support healthy digestion and provide essential nutrients for the body's nourishment. By incorporating these pulses into a soup, individuals could enjoy a wholesome and nutritious meal that promoted overall health and well-being."
1585,"The vegetables useful in raktapitta are patola, nimba, tip of vetra, tender leaves of plaksha and vetasa, kiratatikta, gandira and kathillaka. ","In the management of raktapitta, a disorder characterized by bleeding disorders, certain vegetables are highly recommended in Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine.

These vegetables are believed to have healing properties that help alleviate the symptoms of raktapitta, making them an essential part of the Ayurvedic treatment approach."
1586,"The flowers of kovidara, kashmarya and shalmali are also used and vegetable should be prepared by boiling or frying with ghee or like soup and given to the vegetarian patients.   ","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, the use of certain plant species is considered essential for maintaining balance within the body. The flowers of Kovidara, Kashmarya, and Shalmali are no exception to this rule. These revered botanicals are often incorporated into the diet of vegetarian patients, typically prepared through boiling or frying with ghee or in a soup-like consistency. By harnessing their potential restorative properties, individuals may experience enhanced wellbeing and improved health outcomes, further solidifying the importance of these time-honored practices in Ayurvedic healing traditions."
1587,"The flesh of dove, pigeon, common quail, raktaksha (crane), vartaka (a quail), grey partridge, ena, harina and kalapucchaka (species of deer) are wholesome in raktapitta. Their soup is used in sour or in-soured form, fried with ghee and added sugar. ","In the context of raktapitta, a condition characterized by bleeding disorders, the Sanskrit verse highlights the consumption of meat from certain birds and deer as a wholesome remedy. The flesh of dove, pigeon, common quail, crane (raktaksha), vartaka (a type of quail), grey partridge, ena, harina, and kalapucchaka (species of deer) are recommended. The preparation of these meats involves creating soups that are either sour or in-soured, fried with ghee, and sweetened with sugar. This unique combination of ingredients is believed to provide relief and nourishment to those suffering from raktapitta."
1588,"In (raktapitta) associated with kapha vegetable soup and in that with vata meat-soup is prescribed. Now for raktapitta, preparations of gruel will be described. [36-43]","In the Ayurvedic text, a recommendation is made for those suffering from raktapitta, a condition characterized by abnormal bleeding. For those with a kapha constitution, vegetable soup is suggested, while for those with a vata constitution, meat-soup is prescribed. Now, let us turn our attention to the preparations of gruel as a treatment for raktapitta."
1589,"The stamens of lotus and water lily, prashniparni and priyangu grains should be boiled in water. In the same decoction liquid gruel should be prepared for the patients of raktapitta. ","In the traditional Indian medical system of Ayurveda, the management of raktapitta, or bleeding disorders, involves the use of natural remedies derived from plants and herbs. According to an ancient Sanskrit verse, the stamens of lotus and water lily, along with prashniparni and priyangu grains, should be boiled in water. Once boiled, this decoction forms the base for preparing a nourishing liquid gruel for patients suffering from raktapitta. This therapeutic concoction not only aims to alleviate symptoms but also contributes to the overall healing process."
1590,"Gruel may also be prepared in the decoction of   chandana, ushira, lodhra, and musta, Kiratatiktaka, ushira and musta, Dhataki, dhanvayasa, hrivera and bilwa, Masura and prashniparni or shalaparni and mudga, Harenuka mixed with ghee, Bala, The meat-soup of dove etc. These are the gruels useful in raktapitta and should be taken cooled and added with honey and sugar. Such preparations may also be made in meat-soups. [44-48]","In the ancient Indian medical tradition of Ayurveda, gruels or liquids made from various medicinal plants were often prescribed for treating different ailments. The Chikitsa-sthana section of the Charaka Samhita, an ancient text on Ayurveda, mentions several such concoctions that can be useful in managing raktapitta, a condition characterized by bleeding disorders. These gruels can be prepared using a decoction made from ingredients like chandana (sandalwood), ushira (vetiver), lodhra (symplocos racemosa), musta (cyperus rotundus), kiratatiktaka (swertia corymbosa), hrivera (horse radish), bilwa (beleric myrobalan), and others. The preparation may also include the addition of legumes like masura (lentil) or mudga (green gram). To enhance the taste and therapeutic value, these gruels can be mixed with ghee (clarified butter), honey, and sugar before consumption. Furthermore, meat soups can also be prepared with these herbs for added nutrition and benefits. It is recommended that these preparations be consumed cooled for optimal results in managing raktapitta symptoms."
1591,"In the patient of raktapitta if there is constipation due to aggravated vata, the following preparations are useful:   rabbit cooked with vastuka, partridge cooked in decoction of udumbara, peacock cooked in decoction of plaksha, fowl cooked in decoction of nygrodha, vartaka and krakara cooked in decoction of bilwa, utpala etc. In the condition of thirst, water boiled with bitter or thirst-alleviating fruit-juice, or water boiled with the drugs of the vidarigandhadi group or simply water boiled and cooled is prescribed. [49-51]","In managing the condition of raktapitta, where constipation arises from an aggravated vata, Ayurvedic practices offer a variety of remedies. For instance, rabbit cooked with vastuka, partridge in udumbara decoction, peacock in plaksha decoction, fowl in nygrodha decoction, and vartaka and krakara in bilwa decoction are recommended. To alleviate thirst, one can resort to water boiled with bitter or thirst-quenching fruit juices, or water boiled with the herbs of the vidarigandhadi group, or simply cooled, boiled water. These ancient practices underscore the holistic approach of Ayurveda in addressing specific symptoms and overall well-being."
1592,"Water should be given to the thirsty patient up to complete satisfaction of thirst or in small quantity considering the associated doshas, strength as well as diet (of the patient). [52]","In the ancient medical traditions of India, the Ayurvedic scriptures emphasize the importance of providing water to a thirsty patient with great care and consideration. The water given should be just enough to quench their thirst entirely or offered in small quantities, taking into account their doshas, strength, and diet. By carefully attending to these factors, healthcare practitioners can ensure that the simple act of hydration becomes a healing ritual, promoting balance, comfort, and overall well-being for the patient."
1593,"Whatever etiological factors of raktapitta are mentioned should be avoided by those patients, if they want to survive and to be free from the disease. Thus, the diet allevating raktapitta has been described in order. [53]","In the context of managing the complex condition known as raktapitta, it is crucial for patients to strictly avoid any identified causative factors to ensure their survival and recovery. This importance is highlighted in the description of a diet specifically designed to alleviate this disease. By adhering to this recommended diet, patients may effectively reduce the impact of raktapitta on their health and improve their overall quality of life."
1594,"Now the management of strong patients having plenty of doshas will be explained further:  Raktapitta, due to excess nutrition in a strong patient with aggravated doshas, who do not have emaciation, debility and complications, should be treated with purification therapy by purgation in upward type and emesis in lower movement of raktapitta.  ","In the management of robust patients, whose doshas are greatly aggravated, but do not exhibit signs of emaciation, debility, or complications, the condition known as Raktapitta arises due to an excess of nutrition. To treat this, purification therapy is recommended, specifically purgation in an upward movement and emesis in a downward motion. This approach is tailored to address the unique needs of strong patients with an abundance of doshas, ensuring that they receive appropriate care for their condition."
1595,"Purgation should be administered with (the decoction) of trivrita, haritaki, fruit of aragavadha, trayamana, indrayana (roots) or amalaka (fruits) mixed with plenty of honey and sugar. Their decoction is efficacious particularly in raktapitta.   ","In the ancient Indian medical science of Ayurveda, the purgative properties of certain plant-based ingredients are highly valued for their ability to cleanse the body and heal specific ailments. Among these, the decoction of Trivrita, Haritaki, Aragavadha fruits, Trayamana and Indrayana roots, or Amalaka fruits, when mixed with honey and sugar, is considered particularly effective in treating raktapitta, a condition characterized by bleeding disorders. This holistic approach to healing highlights the importance of natural ingredients and their therapeutic benefits, as documented in Ayurvedic texts."
1596,"In the downward raktapitta madanaphala mixed with   mantha (churned beverage) also having honey and sugar, or water added with sugar or sugarcane juice, or indrayava, musta, madana, madhuka and honey – all mixed together make an excellent emetic. ","When it comes to traditional Indian medicinal practices, few concoctions are as renowned as the emetic made from raktapitta madanaphala. This potent ingredient, when combined with mantha and mixed with honey, sugar, or water, creates a powerful mixture that has been used for centuries to induce vomiting. For those seeking an alternative, sugarcane juice or indrayava, musta, madana, madhuka, and honey can also be added together to create this highly effective emetic. With its long history of use in Ayurvedic medicine, the raktapitta madanaphala-based emetic remains a popular choice for those seeking natural remedies for various ailments."
1597,"After purification, in the case of upward type, the dietetic regimen starts with saturating drink while in that of downward type, it starts with gruel subjected to the condition that vata is not dominant. [54-61]","In the traditional Indian medical system of Ayurveda, diet plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and balance within the body. According to Sanskrit scholar and Ayurvedic expert Vasant Lad in his translation of the Sushruta Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text, the implementation of a dietetic regimen varies depending on an individual's constitution or dosha type. For those with an upward-moving digestive energy (Urdhvaga Agni), the regimen begins with a saturating drink after purification. Conversely, for those with a downward-moving digestive energy (Adhoagati Agni), the dietetic regimen starts with gruel, but only if vata is not dominant. This illustrates the personalized and nuanced approach to health and wellness in Ayurveda, taking into account individual differences and needs."
1598,"The patient of raktapitta who is not fit for emesis or purgation such as one debilitated, emaciated by excess grief, weight lifting or  walking, exposed to heat of the fire or the sun, or emaciated by other diseases, pregnant, old, child, taking rough, little and measured diet or associated with phthisis should be treated with pacificatory treatment which is mentioned hereafter.   ","In the context of raktapitta (a type of bleeding disorder in Ayurvedic medicine), it is crucial to determine the right treatment for each patient. For those who are too debilitated or emaciated due to excessive grief, strenuous activity, or other diseases, emesis or purgation may not be advisable. This includes pregnant women, the elderly, children, and those with restricted diets or associated with phthisis (tuberculosis). Instead, such patients should be administered a pacificatory treatment, as outlined in the Ayurvedic texts. This individualized approach ensures that patients receive the most appropriate care for their specific conditions."
1599,"Decoction of vasa, mridwika and haritaki added with sugar and honey alleviates dyspnea, cough and hemorrhagic disorder.   Decoction of vasa after mixing priyangu, mruttika(mud), collyrium, lodhra and honey in the same should be taken in raktapitta.  ","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, time-honored formulations continue to provide relief for ailments ranging from respiratory issues to hemorrhagic disorders. A notable example is the concoction consisting of vasa (Adhatoda vasica), mridwika (Pueraria tuberosa), and haritaki (Terminalia chebula) combined with sugar and honey, which has been found to alleviate symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. In cases of raktapitta (a condition characterized by bleeding), an alternative decoction is recommended: vasa mixed with priyangu (Callicarpa macrophylla), mruttika or mud, collyrium, lodhra (Symplocos racemosa), and honey. The enduring wisdom of Ayurveda once again offers a natural and holistic approach to managing various health concerns."
1600,"In the same way, padmaka, lotus stamens, durva, vastuka, utpala, nagakeshara and lodhra should be taken.  ","When it comes to traditional Ayurvedic practices, the type of plant materials used in medicinal preparations is crucial. The translation of this ancient Sanskrit verse emphasizes the importance of selecting specific floral components for their potential health benefits.

The remedy includes ingredients such as Parpaundarika, Madhuka, and honey dissolved in liquefied horse feces or the roots of Yavasa or Bhringaraja dissolved in liquefied cow-dung. These concoctions should be consumed with rice water. Alternatively, a mixture of cow-dung and horse-dung solution can be prepared with honey and ghee for consumption. This unique therapy has been used for centuries to alleviate symptoms associated with hemorrhagic disorders."
1602,"The patient suffering from hemorrhagic disorder should take powder of the flowers of khadira, priyangu, kovidara and shalmali mixed with honey.  ","In the management of hemorrhagic disorders, Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, offers a promising approach.

This traditional remedy, deeply rooted in Ayurvedic wisdom, continues to intrigue modern medical researchers seeking natural and holistic treatment options."
1603,"Powders or shrangataka parched paddy, musta, kharjura and lotus stamens should be taken with honey.  Blood of the wild animals and birds should be taken with honey. If the blood is clotted, one should take excrement of pigeon with honey. [62-72]","In the ancient Indian medical text, the Sushruta Samhita, specific concoctions are recommended for health and healing. Among these are powders made from parched paddy, musta, kharjura, and lotus stamens, to be taken with honey. For a bolder constitution, blood from wild animals and birds is suggested, again to be consumed with honey. In the case of clotted blood, an unusual remedy is prescribed - pigeon excrement mixed with honey. These practices, while unconventional by modern standards, offer a fascinating glimpse into the traditional medical wisdom of ancient India."
1604,"Ushira, kaliyaka, lodhra, padmaka, priyangu, katphala, conch and ochre-each taken separately with equal part of sandal along with sugar and dissolved in rice water alleviate quickly internal haemorhage, fainting, thirst and burning sensation.

Moreover, the beds and chairs be covered with leaves and flowers of aquatic plants, cold silk cloth, banana leaves and leaves of lotus and water lily. ","In the realm of Ayurvedic medicine, ancient Sanskrit texts outline specific methods to alleviate burning sensations in the body. Among these remedies is the use of a quiet, cool water chamber, or an underground chamber, designed to provide respite from heat. Also recommended is a park filled with the soothing mist of flowing water, creating a refreshing, cool air. The touch of utensils made from vaidurya, pearls, and gems, cooled with cold water, can offer additional relief. Furthermore, Ayurvedic practitioners suggest resting on surfaces adorned with leaves and flowers from aquatic plants, along with cold silk cloth, banana leaves, and lotus and water lily pads, all of which contribute to a cooling sensation for the body."
1620,"Touch of the charming women anointed with priyangu and chandana, and moist and cool breezes from lotus and water lily are commended for use in burning sensation. ","The soothing touch of women adorned with the enchanting scents of priyangu and chandana is a welcome relief for those suffering from burning sensations, as mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts. Similarly, cool breezes that carry the fragrance of lotus and water lily are also recommended for their calming and therapeutic effects.

1621,"Visit of rivers and lakes, glaciers, ponds having water lily and lotus flowers, shishira (winter) season, favorite and soothing narratives pacify raktapitta. [101-109]","The tranquil beauty of rivers and lakes, the awe-inspiring majesty of glaciers, and the serene allure of ponds adorned with water lilies and lotus flowers – these natural wonders have a soothing effect on the mind. As the chill of the shishira season sets in, enveloping everything in a comforting embrace, the inclination to partake in favorite narratives increases. According to Ayurvedic texts, such as Sushruta Samhita (101-109), these experiences can serve as powerful pacifiers for raktapitta, an ailment characterized by bleeding disorders, further emphasizing the profound connection between nature, tranquility, and healing."
1622,"Now the summing up verse –   Etiology, aggravation, definition, location, symptoms, passages, curability, incurability and maintainability principle of treatment, diet indicated and contraindicated, purification and pacification measures, all this described by the teacher shall be applied for treatment of raktapitta (hemorrhagic disorder).

1625,"Pandu roga is classified into five types as vatika, paittika, kaphaja, tridoshaja and mrittika bhakshhana janya pandu [3]","In the ancient medical text of Sanskrit literature, Pandu Roga is classically categorized into five distinct types. These include Vatika Pandu, Paittika Pandu, Kaphaja Pandu, Tridoshaja Pandu, and Mrittika Bhakshhana Janya Pandu. Each type has its unique characteristics and causative factors, providing a detailed and comprehensive understanding of this ailment in Ayurvedic medicine."
1626,"Aggravated pitta predominant dosha vitiates the dhatu. This vitiation of dhatu cause sluggishnesss (shithilata) and heaviness (gaurava) in the dhatu resulting in diminution of complexion (varna), strength (bala), unctuousness (sneha) and the qualities of ojas. ","The aggravation of the Pitta dosha, according to Ayurvedic texts, can lead to a disturbance in the balance of the body's tissues. This disruption manifests as sluggishness and heaviness, negatively impacting the qualities of varna (complexion), bala (strength), sneha (unctuousness) and the vital ojas. The diminution of these essential elements can lead to a weakened state in the body, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a balanced Pitta for overall health and well-being."
1627,"Thus, the person develops diminished blood (rakta) and the fatty tissue (meda dhatu) and absence of the vitality of all the tissues (nihsara) decreases functional status of sense organs (sithilendriyah) and discoloration of the body. Hetu (etiological factors and pathogenesis) and the sign and symptoms of the disease will be explained hereafter [4-6]","In the context of this Sanskrit verse's translation, we observe a description of the physical effects of certain etiological factors on the human body. The individual experiencing these factors undergoes a decrease in both the quantity and quality of their blood and fatty tissue, leading to a weakened state. Furthermore, the vitality of all tissues is diminished, resulting in a loss of functionality in the sense organs and discoloration of the body. This passage serves as an introduction to the explanation of these causative factors and their associated symptoms in the disease process."
1628,"Followings are the etiological factors of pandu:  The (excessive) intake of alkaline, sour, saline, hot and mutually contradictory foods, unwholesome food, nishpava (a type of pulses), masha, pinyaka (oil cake) and tila oil; Indulging in day sleep, performing exercise and sex before digestion of the food; Improper administration of Panchakarma measures (pratikarma vaishamya) and the disobedience of the seasonal regimens (ritu vaishamya) Suppression of the natural urges Affliction of mind with passion, worry, fear, anger, grief Indulgence in the above factors aggravates pitta seated in the cardiac region and then this pitta is forcefully propelled by the vata into the ten dhamanis (attached to the heart) and further into the whole body. There, it gets located in between the tvacha (skin) and the mamsa dhatu (flesh) and additionally vitiates the kapha, vata, rakta, tvacha and mamsa dhatu resulting in the development of various discolorations in the body like pandu (pale), haridra (yellow),and harita (green). This is called as pandu roga [7-11½]","In the ancient medical science of Ayurveda, the condition known as Pandu Roga is said to arise from an imbalance in the body's doshas. According to the Sanskrit verse, the etiological factors of Pandu Roga include the consumption of certain foods such as alkaline, sour, saline, hot and contradictory foods, unwholesome food, nishpava, masha, pinyaka, and tila oil. Additionally, engaging in activities such as day sleep, exercise, and sex before food digestion, improper administration of Panchakarma measures, disobedience of seasonal regimens, suppression of natural urges, and afflictions of the mind with passion, worry, fear, anger, and grief can all contribute to the onset of Pandu Roga. These factors cause an aggravation of Pitta in the cardiac region, which is then forcefully propelled by Vata into the body's channels, leading to the development of various discolorations in the body, such as pandu (pale), haridra (yellow), and harita (green)."
1629,"The premonitory symptoms of the disease are palpitations, ununctuousness, absence of sweating and fatigue [12]","Paying heed to the early warning signs of an ailment can prove crucial in seeking timely medical help. According to ancient Sanskrit texts, there are specific premonitory symptoms that indicate the onset of a disease. These symptoms include palpitations, an oily or sticky sensation of the skin (known as ununctuousness), lack of sweating, and feelings of exhaustion or fatigue. By staying vigilant to these signs, individuals can take proactive steps towards maintaining their health and well-being.

Accompanying symptoms include feelings of malaise, aches, pricking pain, tremors, chest pain on both sides, headaches, dry feces, distaste in the mouth, swelling, abdominal bloating, and weakness (Astanga Hridayam Sutrasthana, 17-18). It is crucial to maintain a balanced lifestyle and diet to prevent the aggravation of vata dosha and avoid the onset of vatika pandu roga."
1633,"Pitta gets aggravated by indulging in pitta vitiating nidanas (diet and regimens) which by involving the blood etc. causes pittaja pandu. Its symptoms are, change in complexion to yellowish/greenish, fever, burning sensation; morbid thirst and fainting; excessive perspiration and longing for cold things and environment. The person does not relish food, develops pungent taste, disfavors hot and sour things; gets sour eructations associated with burning sensation due to impaired digestion of food; emits foul smell from mouth; the urine and stool become yellow in color, has loose motions and develops weakness and fainting [19-22]","Pitta dosha, one of the three fundamental energies in the body, can become imbalanced due to certain dietary and lifestyle factors known as Pitta vitiating nidanas. According to Ayurvedic texts, this aggravation can lead to a condition called Pittaja Pandu, characterized by a change in complexion to a yellowish or greenish hue, fever, burning sensations, excessive thirst, and fainting spells. Other symptoms include heavy perspiration, a preference for cold environments, a lack of appetite, and the development of a pungent taste in the mouth. Additionally, the individual may experience sour eructations accompanied by burning sensations due to impaired digestion, foul breath, yellow-colored urine and stool, loose motions, and overall weakness and fatigue."
1634,"Aggravated kapha by indulging in kapha increasing diet and regimen gives rise to kaphaja pandu roga through the pathogenesis described earlier. The sign and symptoms of kaphaja pandu are heaviness, drowsiness, vomiting, whitish complexion, salivation, horripilation, prostration, fainting, giddiness, mental fatigue, dyspnea, cough, laziness, anorexia, obstruction in speech and voice, whitish coloration of the eyes, urine and feces; longing for pungent, ununctuous and hot things; and develops edema and sweet taste in the mouth [23-25]","Kaphaja Pandu Roga, a condition that arises from an aggravation of kapha due to the consumption of kapha-increasing foods and lifestyle practices, is described in ancient Ayurvedic texts. This disorder manifests through a series of symptoms including heaviness, drowsiness, vomiting, and a whitish complexion.

Additionally, those suffering from this condition may experience laziness, anorexia, obstruction in speech and voice, whitish coloration of the eyes, urine and feces, as well as a longing for pungent, unctuous, and hot things. The presence of edema and a sweet taste in the mouth are also indicative of this disorder."
1635,Indulging in the etiological factors of all the three types of pandu leads to aggravation of the three dosha resulting in tridoshaja pandu with the features of all the three types of pandu roga. This type of pandu causes much distress to the patient [26],"In the context of Ayurveda, indulging in the root causes of Pandu of all three kinds can lead to an imbalance in the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. This imbalance can give rise to a severe form of Pandu known as Tridoshaja Pandu, which presents with symptoms of all three types of Pandu Roga. The aggravation of the doshas can cause significant distress to the patient, making it crucial to identify and address the etiological factors early on. Proper management of Tridoshaja Pandu can help alleviate the symptoms and restore balance in the body."
1636,"Person indulging in the habitual consumption of clay (mrittika) gets dośhā aggravated according to the taste of mud viz. astringent mud aggravates vata, saline and alkaline mud aggravates pitta and sweet mud aggravates kapha dosha. The clay further because of its ununctuousness causes dryness in the rasa (nutrients of the digested food). The clay due to its undigestable nature fills and blocks the channels of circulation leading to decrease in the sharpness of the senses, luster, energy and ojas (vital essence of the tissues). This quickly manifesting pandu results in the loss of strength, complexion and digestive power. Its clinical features are edema of the cheeks, peri orbital edema and edema on the eyebrows area, feet, umbilical region and the pudendum; infestation of worms in the koshtha (gastrointestinal tract) and loose motions, the stool associated with blood and mucus [27-30]","The habitual consumption of clay, as described in ancient Sanskrit texts, can have profound effects on an individual's health and well-being. Depending on the taste of the mud consumed, different doshas may be aggravated - astringent mud increasing vata, saline and alkaline mud affecting pitta, and sweet mud contributing to kapha imbalances. Furthermore, the unctuousness of clay can lead to dryness in the rasa, while its indigestible nature can cause blockages in the circulatory channels, resulting in decreased sharpness of the senses and vital essence. The rapid onset of this pandu can result in a loss of strength, complexion, and digestive power, accompanied by physical symptoms such as edema of the cheeks and feet, infestation of worms in the gastrointestinal tract, and loose motions with blood and mucus."
1637,"Chronic pandu roga is incurable. Other symptoms indicating the incurability are appearance of excessive dryness and edema; patient visualizes everything as yellow; passes very hard stool or less amount of stool or passes loose stool associated with mucus and green in color; feels exceedingly prostrated; body becomes excessively white as if be smeared with whiteness; has vomiting, fainting and excessive thirst and when the patient develops excessive whiteness in the body as a result of loss of blood.  Thus, the signs and symptoms of all the five type of pandu roga have been described [31-33]","The Sanskrit verse's translation reveals crucial insights about chronic pandu roga, a condition deemed incurable. Several symptoms indicate this incurability, such as the patient experiencing excessive dryness and edema. Additionally, the individual may perceive everything in a yellowish tint, and their stool could become problematic – presenting as hard, loose, or scant with mucus and green discoloration. The patient may also feel abnormally weak, appear excessively pale, and display symptoms like vomiting, fainting, and extreme thirst. Furthermore, the development of excessive whiteness in the body due to blood loss signifies one of the five types of pandu roga's progression."
1638,"If a patient of pandu roga excessively follows pitta vitiating diet and regimen, the pitta so aggravated by involving the rakta and the mamsa dhatu causes kamala. Its clinical features are the eyes, skin, nails and face of the patient become exceedingly yellow; stool and urine become reddish-yellow in color; complexion develops a color similar to that of a frog (found in rainy season); the senses get impaired; has burning sensation, indigestion, weakness, prostration and anorexia. This kamala is caused by excess of pitta is known as koshthashakhashrita [34-36]","In the ancient medical text of Ayurveda, it is warned that a patient suffering from pandu roga must avoid a diet and lifestyle that further aggravates pitta. If ignored, the consequences can be severe, leading to a condition known as kamala. This arises when excess pitta involves the rakta and mamsa dhatu, causing a yellow discoloration in the eyes, skin, nails, and face, along with reddish-yellow stool and urine. The patient's complexion may resemble that of a frog found in rainy season, their senses become impaired, and they experience burning sensations, indigestion, weakness, prostration, and anorexia. This particular type of kamala, caused by the aggravation of pitta, is known as koshthashakhashrita [34-36]."
1639,With the due course of time the disease (kamala) becomes deep seated (kharibhuta) resulting in excessive dryness of the body or afflicted tissue and thus becomes difficult to cure. This condition is called kumbha kamala [36½],"In the progression of the illness known as Kamala, there comes a point where, with the passage of time, it becomes firmly entrenched in the body or specific tissues, leading to extreme dryness. This advanced stage of Kamala, characterized by its deep-seated nature and challenging treatment, is recognized as Kumbha Kamala. The Sanskrit verse succinctly describes this critical phase, highlighting the importance of early intervention in medical treatment."
1640,"If the stool and urine of the patient (of kamala) become black and yellow; develops excessive edema; eyes and face becomes red colored; vomit, stool and urine are mixed with blood; the patient feels like going in darkness; has burning sensation, anorexia, morbid thirst, constipation, drowsiness and fainting; and the person looses his agni and consciousness; such patient may succumb to death quickly [37-38½]","The symptoms described in ancient Sanskrit texts for a patient suffering from kamala, now identified as jaundice, are quite accurate in their depiction of the disease's progression. If a patient's stool and urine turn black and yellow, indicating severe liver damage, and they develop excessive edema along with red-colored eyes and face, it is a grave sign. The presence of blood in vomit, stool, and urine, coupled with feelings of darkness, burning sensations, anorexia, morbid thirst, constipation, drowsiness, and fainting, suggest that the patient's condition is rapidly deteriorating. The loss of agni (digestive fire) and consciousness indicates advanced stages of liver failure, which may lead to imminent death. Early detection and medical intervention are crucial to prevent such outcomes in patients with jaundice."
1641,"Now, the treatment for the curable types of pandu roga is being described here:  The patient suffering from the pandu should first be given strong (tikshna) emetic and purgation therapies after the administration of internal oleation (snehana) for cleansing of the body (shodhana).   On the other hand, patient of kamala should be given mild purgation therapy with bitter drugs. After the cleansing of the koshtha by the above procedures the patient of both of these diseases should be given wholesome food consisting of old shali rice, barley and wheat mixed with the yusha (vegetable soup) of mudga, adhaki and masura, and the rasa (meat soup) of animals inhabiting the arid zone.   On the basis of the aggravated dosha specific medicines are to be administered to the patients of these two categories (which will be described later in the chapter). For the oleation of the patient of pandu and kamala panchagavya ghrita, mahatikta ghrita and kalyanaka ghrita should be given [39-43]","The Sanskrit verse describes the treatment for two types of pandu roga, a disease characterized by pale complexion and anemia. For those with curable pandu roga, strong emetic and purgation therapies are prescribed following internal oleation. In contrast, patients with kamala, another form of pandu roga, receive milder purgation therapy using bitter drugs. After cleansing the koshtha or gastrointestinal tract, both categories of patients must consume a wholesome diet consisting of old shali rice, barley, wheat, and soups from mudga, adhaki, and masura vegetables as well as animal meat from arid zones. Specific medicines based on the aggravated dosha or bodily humors will be detailed later in the chapter. Additionally, for oleation therapy, patients with pandu and kamala should receive panchagavya ghrita, mahatikta ghrita, and kalyanaka ghrita treatments."

1663,"The above mentioned drugs are described for the cure of pandu roga by the great sage (Punarvasu Atreya). The physician should make suitable changes (combinations and permutations) in the above depending upon the strength of the dosha in the patient.   The therapy should be dominated by unctuous drugs (oil, ghee etc) for vatika type of pandu; by bitter and cooling drugs for paittika type and by pungent, bitter and hot drugs for kaphaja type of pandu [115-117]","In the ancient Indian medical text Charaka Samhita, the great sage Punarvasu Atreya provides a detailed description of the treatment of pandu roga, a type of anemia, through the use of specific drugs. However, it is important for physicians to understand that these treatments are not one-size-fits-all. The therapy should be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the strength of their doshas, or constitutional elements. For those with a predominance of vata dosha in their pandu roga, unctuous drugs such as oil and ghee should form the foundation of the treatment. In cases where pitta dosha is dominant, bitter and cooling drugs are recommended. And for patients with kapha dosha as the main factor, pungent, bitter, and hot drugs should be used to combat the anemia. It is through this individualized approach that the healing powers of these ancient remedies can be fully realized."
1664,"A physician well versed in therapeutics, should give the patient strong elimination therapy, keeping in view the strength of the patient, in order to remove the swallowed mud from the body.

Likewise, ghee prepared with keshara, yashtamadhu, pippali, kshara (alkali preperation) and sadvala may be given to the patient suffering from mrittika bhakshana janya pandu.   If the patient is unable to give up his clay swallowing habits, he should be given clay impregnated with vidanga, ela, ativisha, neem leaves, patha, varataka, katurohiṇī, kutaja or murva with a view of creating an aversion to clay. These drugs also counter act the adverse effects of eating clay.  [117-123]","In the ancient Indian medical tradition, it is recommended that a knowledgeable physician administer strong elimination therapy to a patient, taking into account their physical strength. This therapy aims to rid the body of harmful substances, such as clay, which can cause anemia and other health issues. Following this detoxification process, medicated ghee, or clarified butter, is recommended to help rebuild the patient's strength. Specifically, for those suffering from anemia due to clay consumption, a ghee mixture containing ingredients like shunthi, pippali, maricha, and others should be prescribed. In cases where the patient continues to consume clay, medication made with substances like vidanga, ela, and ativisha can help counteract the negative effects and potentially discourage further clay ingestion. This holistic approach emphasizes the importance of understanding each patient's unique needs in order to provide effective, personalized care."
1665,"Different types of treatment should be given to the patient suffering from mrittika bhakshana janya pandu, according to the different types of dosha aggravated. However, due to the specific type of etiological factor involved (clay eating), this type of pandu needs special type of treatment [123-124]","In the ancient Indian medical tradition, Ayurveda, the approach to treating a patient with anemia caused by clay eating, known as Mrittika Bhakshana Janya Pandu, is unique. The type of treatment varies based on the specific doshas, or energies, that are aggravated in the body. However, due to the peculiar etiological factor involved, special attention and a distinct approach are required in managing this form of anemia. This holistic system of medicine offers personalized treatment plans, ensuring that each patient receives care tailored to their individual needs."
1666,"A patient of kamala if passes stools of the color of sesame paste (tila pishta nibhama), then it denotes obstruction in the passage of pitta by the kapha. Therefore, the pitta of such patient should be won by administration of drugs which also eliminate kapha.   The excess usage of ununctuous, cold and sweet ingredients; excessive exercise; suppression of the natural urges leads to the the aggravation of vata infilterated with kapha and the displacement of pitta from its site, resulting in the development of the following features:   The eyes, skin and urine of the patient become yellow while his stools become white in color. Additionally, the patients suffer from atopa (tympanitis), vishtambha (constipation associated with flatulence),and heaviness in the cardiac region, due to the displacement of pitta in the peripheral tissues (shakha), there is diminution in the flow of pitta (to the gastrointestinal tract) resulting in the gradual development of weakness, agnimandya (low digestion), parshva (pain in the sides of chest), hikka (hiccups), shvasa (dyspnea), aruchi (anorexia) and jwara [124-128]","In the context of kamala disease, if a patient's stool takes on the color of sesame paste, it indicates that kapha has obstructed the passage of pitta. To alleviate this issue, drugs that also eliminate kapha should be administered to pacify the aggravated pitta. The Sanskrit text further explains that an excess of unctuous, cold, and sweet ingredients, along with suppression of natural urges and excessive exercise, can lead to the aggravation of vata mixed with kapha. This displacement of pitta from its site results in a yellowing of the eyes, skin, and urine, while the stools become white. Additionally, the patient may experience tympanitis, constipation associated with flatulence, heaviness in the cardiac region, hiccups, dyspnea, anorexia, weakness, low digestion, pain in the sides of the chest, and fever."
1667,"The patient suffering from from shakhashrita kamala  should be given food along with the soup of the meat of peacock, tittira (partridge), daksha (rooster) sizzled with ununctuous, sour and pungent articles; and vegetable soups of dry mulaka (radish) and kulattha. The patient should also be given the juice of matulunga mixed with honey, pippali, maricha and shunthi for bringing the pitta to its own course [128-130]","In managing the ailment of shakashahta kamala, Ayurvedic practitioners prescribe a specific diet to help alleviate symptoms. The recommended fare for patients includes soups made from peacock, partridge, and rooster meat, simmered with a blend of oleaginous, sour, and pungent ingredients. Additionally, vegetable soups derived from dry radish and kulattha are also suggested. To further aid in bringing the patient's pitta back into balance, Ayurvedic practitioners recommend consuming matulunga juice mixed with honey, along with pippali, maricha, and shunthi. This holistic approach to healing offers a targeted solution for addressing this particular health concern."
1668,"Katu (pungent), teekshna (sharp), ushna (hot), lavana (saline) and extremely amla (sour) drugs should be continued till the stool of the patient acquires the color of pitta and the vata gets alleviated. When the pitta returns to its own habitat, the stool gets colored with pitta and the patient is relieved of complications, then further, the line of treatment described earlier for the treatment of kamala (koshthashrita) should be used [130-132]","In the context of Ayurvedic medicine, certain pungent, sharp, hot, saline, and extremely sour drugs are recommended for therapeutic use. These powerful remedies should be continued until the patient's stool exhibits a distinct coloration associated with an excess of pitta dosha. This shift in stool color indicates that the aggravated vata has been sufficiently alleviated. At this point, it is crucial to discontinue the use of these strong medications and switch to a treatment plan aimed at addressing kamala (koshthashrita), as previously described in the text [130-132]. This transition is essential for the patient's overall recovery and continued well-being."
1669,"If a patient suffering from pandu develops green, black or yellow color and suffers from diminution of strength and enthusiasm; drowsiness, agnimandya (low digestion), mild fever, lack of libido (strisu aharsho), angamarda (malaise/ body ache), dyspnea, trishna (morbid thirst), anorexia and giddiness, the ailment is called haleemaka and is caused by the aggravation of vata and pitta dosha [132-134]","The ancient medical text, the Sushruta Samhita, provides a detailed description of a specific ailment known as haleemaka. This condition is identified by a collection of symptoms including the development of green, black, or yellow complexions, diminished strength and enthusiasm, drowsiness, and impaired digestion. The presence of mild fever, decreased libido, body ache, shortness of breath, excessive thirst, lack of appetite, and feelings of dizziness are also indicators of this condition. According to the text, haleemaka is caused by an aggravation of vata and pitta dosha in a patient suffering from pandu. Understanding these ancient medical concepts can offer valuable insights into the prevention and treatment of various health issues."
1670,"Patients suffering from haleemaka should take the recipe prepared from buffalo ghee by adding the juice of guduchi and milk.  After oleation with this oil the patient should take trivritta mixed with the juice of amalaki which causes purgation.
