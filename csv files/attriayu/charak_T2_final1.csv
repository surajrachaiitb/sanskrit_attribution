The translation attempts to convey the meaning of the original Sanskrit verse while being grammatically correct and contextually sensible in English. The compound words ""sita-upalā"" and ""dvi-guṇita"" have been translated as ""a mixture of sugar"" and ""twice that amount"" respectively, in order to provide a clearer understanding of their meaning in this context. The verb ""lehayet"" has been translated as ""should be cause to be eaten"" to convey the sense of causing or making something be eaten, as indicated by the causative form of the verb. The translation aims to be both accurate and readable in English, while still maintaining fidelity to the original Sanskrit text.",

From this same sap of human beings, their solid parts become firm, and from the fat, marrow is produced. If the subtle parts of marrow and fat increase, then a fluidity like that of butter and oil arises in the bones, in the case of both humans and animals. When this fluidity arises, then they say that semen becomes active; always present, it is spoken of as flowing out by wise people. If it finds a place in the middle of the body of living beings, then a split appears, and it becomes visible. A split occurs in the bones, and it emerges; or perhaps not.

This enhanced translation attempts to capture the meaning of the given Sanskrit verse, using the word splits and morphological tags as a guide. It interprets the verse in a way that explains the process of how a human being becomes capable of procreation, by describing the role of various bodily substances such as sap, fat, marrow, fluidity, etc., and their transformations under certain conditions. The use of passive voice in many places adds to the sense of inevitability or naturalness of these transformations, as they are described as objective facts rather than as deliberate actions.",

Similarly, one should prepare a mixture of Citraka, Cavya, and Vyoṣa, after grinding them, and then cause it to become Kasaya by adding a little bit of water. Once it becomes Kasaya, one should soak aCangerisvara Sam plant in it. Once it becomes similar in taste to that Kasaya made of Sarpiṣa, one should cause it to be placed there.
