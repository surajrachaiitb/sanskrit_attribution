The idea is that ""It"" is not perceived in any way by external means. If the world had no root, this creation would be filled with non-existence and would be perceived as non-existent. However, this not being the case, creation is perceived as ""existing"", just as a pot produced from mrittika or earth are perceived as permeated with earth. Therefore the Self, the root of the Universe, is to be realized as existing. Why?"

67,नचिकेतमुपाख्यानं मृत्युप्रोक्तं सनातनम्,"This is Sanaatana Nachiketa story told by Mrityu . 
In this Upanishad, Yama is referred to, not as a person, but by Antaka, Mrityu, and Vaivasvata. Kathopanishad contains the 'secrets of death'. Yama answers these questions, thoughsome may assume this is the act of destiny or blame the paramatma for pushing jiva into different forms of life, it is the own actions or Karma of the Jiva when in bodily form, that makes a Jiva attain births in different life forms."
68,अङ्गुष्ठमात्रः पुरुषोऽन्तरात्मा सदा जनानां हृदये सन्निविष्टः,"In the body, in the hridaya-stana, is seated the thumbsized Jivatma which is immortal."
69,धरति लोकान् ध्रियते पुण्यात्मभिरिति वा ।,"That which holds the world or that which is upheld by meritorious people is Dharma. 
Therefore, Dharma is not just that which is upheld as a virtue in life, it is also the principle on the foundation of which a society stands. Thus, it could also refer to principles of justice , character , behaviour , etc. And has multiple facets viz. Svadharma , Kautumbika dharma , Samajika dharma , Varna dharma , Ashrama dharma , Rashtra dharma , Manava dharma , etc. Therefore, one meaning of Dharma is Achara or the regulation of daily life. In fact, Achara is referred to as the supreme Dharma."

So, earth is believed to have originated from water. According to Tarkasangraha, a basic text of the Nyaya-Vaisheshika schools of Indian philosophy, the characteristic of Prthvi is smell. Prthvi is of two kinds, Nitya and Anitya . It is nitya in the form of Paramanu and anitya in the form of Karya . The earth in the form of products can further be classified into three types viz. body of living beings, sense organs and objects made of earth."
72,द्यौर्मे पिता जनिता नाभिरत्र बन्धुर्मे माता पृथिवी महीयम् ।॥,"Sky is my father, brother and my centre. And this vast earth is my mother who is the greatest.A similar feeling is conveyed in the Atharvaveda as well. It says,"
73,माता भूमिः पुत्रोऽहं पृथिव्याः ॥,"The earth is our mother and I am her son. The Atharvaveda also states that the earth nourishes us, protects our wealth, is the foundation of everything, has gold in itself, is the resort of all moving and non-moving objects, provides happiness to all, nurtures fire within and such a land will endow us with prosperity. Thereby, indirectly emphasizing on the importance of conserving land in the Vedas."
74,यत्ते भूमे विखनामि क्षिप्रं तदपि रोहतु । मा ते मर्म विमृग्वरि मा ते हृदयमर्पिपम् ॥,"O land! If I dig any part of you, it should be filled immediately. O discoverable earth! I won't do anything that will either hurt your heart or harm you. This personal prayer towards the earth shows how sensitive the Vedic Rishi is towards the earth. If a feeling of this kind is fostered in the minds then land conservation will happen of its own accord. Infact, conservation of land in the Vedas is inherent in the protection of one's motherland. Expressing concern for the preservation of the Earth, the Rishi further states, in the Prthvi Sukta, that one must be ready for even self-sacrifice for the protection of the Earth."
75,उपस्थास्ते अनमीवा अयक्ष्मा अस्मभ्यं सन्तु पृथिवि प्रसूताः । दीर्घं न आयुः प्रतिबुध्यमाना वयं तुभ्यं बलिहृतः स्याम ॥,"O Earth! All of us who have gained birth from you, may we all be healthy and longlived in your lap. And may we ever remain ready to sacrifice self-benefit for the sake of motherland and remain ever-ready in your service. Such is the spirit of land conservation in the Vedas. The Rigveda also speaks on conservation of natural resources. The Aranyani sukta of the Rigveda states that those who love and know the importance of forests never destroy the forests nor do any other violence towards such forest lovers."
76,इन्द्रो यातूनामभवत्पराशरो हविर्मथीनामभ्या विवासताम् अभीदु शक्रः परशुर्यथा वनं पात्रेव भिन्दन्त्सत एति रक्षसः,"Indra is the destroyer, like the Parashara, of those Rakshasas that harm the one who offer havishya , just like the that destroys the forest is capable of smashing the earthen vessels. 
Rigveda describes the strength and valor of Indra and the faith of Devatas in his might, in the following mantra"
77,नहि नु यादधीमसीन्द्रं को वीर्या परः तस्मिन्नृम्णमुत क्रतुं देवा ओजांसि सं दधुरर्चन्ननु स्वराज्यम्,"For the Devas know no other person in their knowledge, who have surpassed Indra, in strength. In him, the deities have placed their courage, wisdom, valor and prowess."

82,ततः क्रुद्धः सहस्राक्षः पर्वतानां शतक्रतुः पक्षान् चिच्छेद वज्रेण तत्र तत्र सहस्रशः,"Angered by that, the thousand-eyed Indra chopped off wings of hundreds of mountains, then and there, using his Vajrayudha."
83,देवपितृकार्याभ्यां न प्रमदितव्यम् ।,"Never swerve from the rites due to the devas and pitrs. .
The rites due to devas and pitrs manifest in the form of the Panchamahayajnas prescribed as a part of the Varnashrama Dharma. One among the five yajnas is Nru Yajna and Atithi Satkara is one of its important constituents along with Bhikshadana. It is said that,"
84,नृयज्ञोऽतिथिपूजनम्,The honouring of Guests is offering to men .

Manu further adds that the one who serves and offers salutations to the elders, his Ayu , knowledge, fame and strength increases."

It is said that being a teacher of Vedas, a guru's son is considered equivalent to the guru himself, even if younger or same aged as oneself or a student in Yajna karma. Because, just as one obtains water by digging the ground with a spade, so does one obtain the knowledge held by the guru through Seva. Therefore, Seva of three people ie. the mother, father and guru is considered the greatest austerity. It gets accomplished one's duties. And so, one should always do that which is dear to the mother, father and guru. For, by their satisfaction all austerities are considered accomplished."

142,वेदस्वीकरणं कृत्वा स्रायाद्वै दत्तदक्षिणः । नैष्ठिको ब्रह्मचारी वा देहान्तं निवसेद्गुरौ ॥,"A brahmachari should learn the scripture from the preceptor, offer dakshina to the preceptor and perform Samavartana . However, the naishthika brahmachari ie. one who has taken a vow of life-long abstinence should remain with the preceptor till his own death."
143,यदि त्वात्यन्तिकं वासं रोचयेत गुरोः कुले । युक्तः परिचरेदेनं आ शरीरविमोक्षणात् । । । । आचार्ये तु खलु प्रेते गुरुपुत्रे गुणान्विते । गुरुदारे सपिण्डे वा गुरुवद्वृत्तिं आचरेत् । । । । एतेष्वविद्यमानेषु स्थानासनविहारवान् । प्रयुञ्जानोऽग्निशुश्रूषां साधयेद्देहं आत्मनः । । । ।,"If a naishthika brahmachari wishes to spend his entire life in the gurukula, he must carefully engage in the service of his teacher until his last breath. After the time of his guru, he must consider scholarly son of the guru, guru's wife and guru's brothers as equal to his guru. In their absence, he must serve Agni in place of a guru and make his body eligible to attain the brahman through Upasana.
It is in line with this duty that the Yajnavalkya smrti states that the Naishthika brahmachari should live with his acharya. In the absence of the acharya, with his son or wife or even fire."
144,एवं चरति यो विप्रो ब्रह्मचर्यं अविप्लुतः । स गच्छत्युत्तमस्थानं न चेह जायते पुनः । । । ।,"A brahmana who practices unweavering brahmacharya in this manner, he merges with the Supreme being and does not get reborn in this world.
This is reiterated in the Yajnavalkya smrti as well."
145,अनेन विधिना देहं सादयन्विजितेन्द्रियः । ब्रह्मलोकं अवाप्नोति न चेहाजायते पुनः । । । ।,"In this way destroying the body and subduing his senses, he attains the region of Brahma and is not born here again."
146,आवसथ्याधानं दारकाले दायाद्यकाल एकेषाम् ॥,The setting up of Aavasatya agni is at the time of wedding. At the time of inheritance according to some.
147,कच्चिद् अग्निषु ते युक्तो विधिज्नो मतिमान् ऋजुः हुतम् च होष्यमाणम् च काले वेदयते सदा समिधःपावनाः पूज्याः चर्मयुक्ताः परात्पराः युष्मान् हरामि होमार्थं अस्मान् रक्षत सर्वदा ॥,"""I hope that a brahmana who is versed in the traditions, who is intelligent and just, employed in your sacred fires, always informs you in time, about a yajnika agni having been or going to be fed with oblations."""

All the vedas and Puranas, the Veda of Vedas namely Vyakarana , Pitrya , Ganita , Daiva , Nidhi , Vakovaakya Ekayana , Deva vidya Brahmavidya Bhutavidya , Kshtravidya , nakshatra vidya , Sarpavidya - All these are the name only. Meditate on the Name."
149,मनो वाव वाचो भूयो यथा वै द्वे वाऽऽमलके मनो ह्यात्मा मनो लोको मनो हि ब्रह्म मन उपास्स्वेति,"Upon Narada maharshi's inquiry, Sanathkumara explains: Manas is higher than Vak just as one holds two amla fruits or Badri fruits in ones fist, similarly Mind holds Vak and Nama. When one wishes in his mind to read Veda, he reads it, when he wishes in mind to perform actions then he performs them. Only in the mind one desires wealth and children. When a person wishes in mind for this world or the next, he desires for them. Mind is the world, Mind is the Self, indeed and Mind is Parabrahmam. Meditate on the mind."
150,ध्यानं वाव चित्ताद्भूयो ध्यायतीव पृथवी ध्यायतीवान्तरिक्षं ध्यायतीव द्यौर्ध्यायतीवऽऽपो ध्यायन्तीव पर्वता ध्यायन्तीव देवमनुष्यास्तस्माद्य इह मनुष्याणां महत्तां प्रप्नुवन्ति ध्यानापादाँ् शा इवैव ते ध्यानमुपास्स्वेति,"To Narada maharshi's question Sanathkumara replies: Contemplation or meditation is greater than Intelligence. prithivi meditates, as it were, thus do the sky, water, mountains, devatas and the worldly beings. He, among men, who has attained greatness, has done his share of contemplation or meditation. While narrow-minded people are quarrelsome abusive and slandering, great men have reached heights of meditation. Meditate on Contemplation."
151,बलं वाव विज्ञानाद्भूयोऽपि ह शतं विज्ञानवतासेको बलवानाकम्पयते स यदा बली भवत्यथोत्थाता भवत्युत्तिष्ठन् परिचरिता भवति परिचरन्नुपसत्त भवत्युपसीदन्द्रष्टा भवति श्रोता भवति मन्ता भवति बोध्दा भवति बलमुपास्स्वेति,"Continuing his explanation Sanathkumara says: Bala is greater than vijnana. One powerful man shakes a hundred men of knowledge. A man of power rises , attends to, approaches, sees, hears , reflects, understands, acts and hence knows. It is by this Strength that the earth stands, so does the sky, heavens, mountains, devatas and mortals, and all other beings and so does the world. Meditate upon Strength."
152,अन्नं वाव बलाद्भूयस्तस्माद्यद्यपि दशरात्रार्नाश्र्नीयाद्यद्यु ह जीवेदथवाऽद्रष्टाऽश्रोताऽमन्ताऽबोध्दाऽकर्ताऽविज्ञाता भवत्यथान्नस्याऽऽयै द्रष्टा भवति श्रोता भवति मन्ता भवति बोध्दा भवति कर्ता भवति विज्ञाता भवत्यन्नमुपास्स्वेति,"Sanathkumara continues: Food is greater than Strength. For if one does not eat for ten days, though he lives, he is unable to see, hear, reflect, understand, act and know. But '' meaning 'upon one whom food reaches', he is able to do all these things. Meditate on Food."
153,आपो वावान्नाद्भूयस्यस्तस्माद्यदा सुवृष्टिर्न भवति व्याधीयन्ते प्राणा अन्नं कनीयो भविष्यतीत्यथ यदा सुवृष्टिर्भवत्यानन्दिनः प्राणा भवन्त्यन्नं बहु भविष्यतीत्याप एवेमा मूर्ता येयं पृथवी यदन्तरिक्षं मूर्ता अप उपास्स्वेति,"Sanathkumara continues: Water is greater than food. When water is scarce, or vital spirit is troubled as there is less food. When water is sufficiently available, or vital spirit rejoices and plenty of food is available. Water verily manifests in different forms, like earth, sky, heavens, mountains, wind and all living beings. All forms are water, Meditate upon water."
154,तेजो वावाद्भ्यो भूयस्तद्वा एतद्वायुमागृह्नाऽऽकाशमभितपति तदाऽऽहुर्निशोचति नितपति वर्षिष्यति वा इति तेज एव तत्पूर्वं दर्शयित्वाऽथापः सृजते तदेतदूर्ध्वाभिश्च तिरश्चीभिश्च विद्युद्भिराह्रादाश्चरन्ति तेज उपास्स्वेति,"Sanathkumara continues: Fire is greater than water. For through the medium of Vaayu, it warms the Aakasha . Then it is said ""it is hot, it burns, it will rain"". Fire first manifests itself and creates water. Thunders and associated lightnings flash up across the skies. Then it is said "" there is lightning and thunder, it will rain"". It is fire that first shows its presence and creates water. Meditate on fire."
155,आकाशो वाव तेजसो भूयानाकाशे वै सूर्या चन्द्रमसावुभौ विद्युन्नक्षत्राण्यग्निराकाशेनाऽऽह्वयत्याकाशेन प्रतिश्रृणोत्याकाशे रमत आकाशे न रमत आकाशे जायत आकाशमभिजायत आकाशमुपास्स्वेति,"Sanathkumara continues: Aakasha is greater than the Fire. For in Aakasha exist both Surya and Chandra, Lightning, Stars, and Fire. Through the Aakasha we call or talk and hear back because of it. We rejoice or not in Aakasha, in space are all things arise and they grow. Meditate on Aakasha."
156,स्मरो वावाऽऽकाशाद्भूयस्तस्माद्यद्यपि बहव आसीरन्न स्मरन्तो नैव ते कंचन शृणुयुर्नमन्वीरन्न विजानीरन्यदा वाव ते स्मरेयुरथ शृणुयुरथ मन्वीरन्नथ विजानीरन्स्मरेण वै पुत्रान्विजानाति स्मरेण पशून्स्मरमुपास्स्वेति,"Sanathkumara continues: Memory is greater than Aakasha. For even if many are present, if memory is not present, we cannot hear anyone, would not recollect, nor know anyone. Only when Memory is present, one can hear, contemplate and know. Through memory we know our children and cattle. Meditate on Memory."
157,आशा वाव स्मराद्भूयस्याशेद्धो वै स्मरो मन्त्रानधीते कर्मणि कुरुते पुत्राँ्श्च पशूँ्श्चेच्छत इमं च लोकममुं चेच्छत आशामुपास्स्वेति,"Hope is greater than Memory. Kindled by hope does memory read the mantras, perform activities, desire for sons and cattle. Hope fuels desire for this world and the next. Meditate upon Hope."
158,प्राणो वा आशाया भूयान्यथा वा अरा नाभौ समर्पिता एवमस्मिन्प्राणे सर्वँ्समर्पितं प्राणः प्राणेन याति प्राणः प्राणं ददाति प्राणाय ददाति प्राणो ह पिता प्राणो माता प्राणो भ्राता प्राणः स्वसा प्राण आचार्यः प्राणो ब्रह्मणः,"Spirit is greater than Hope. Just as the spokes of a wheel are bound in the center by the nave, so also everything is fastened to the Prana. Prana moves by prana, it gives prana to the prana. Prana is the father, mother, brother and sister and teacher. Prana is the Brahman.
Everything is dependent upon Praana. When unbecoming words are uttered against one's father or other relatives, it is condemned by saying, Shame on you, you may be affected by the papa of killing mother, father and acharya"". Such words signify while the Life force exists. Once life departs the body, even if one is burned to death, he would not be called as a killer. After death, when elders are cremated it is not termed as murder or betrayal, praised as a pious deed. Thus, from both negative and positive instances, it follows that the names ""father"", ""mother"" apply to the Spirit or Life within us."
159,यो वै भूमा तत्सुखं नाल्पे सुखमस्ति भूमैव सुखं भूमा त्वेव विजिज्ञासितव्य इति भूमानं भगवो विजिज्ञास इति,The Infinite is Bliss. There is no bliss in anything finite. The Infinite alone is Bliss. Bhagavan - I desire to understand the Infinite.
160,यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यच्छृणोति नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमाऽथ यत्रान्यत्पश्यत्यन्यच्छृणोत्यन्यद्विजानाति तदल्पं यो वै भूमा तदमृतमथ यदल्पं तन्मर्त्यँ्स भगवः कस्मिन्प्रतिष्ठित इति स्वे महिम्नि यदि वा न महिम्नीति,"When one sees nothing, hears nothing else, understands nothing else - that is the Infinite. When one sees, hears and understands something - that is Finite. That which is Infinite is Immortal and that which is Finite is mortal."
161,अपराबाधमक्लेशं प्रयत्नेनार्जीतं धनम् । स्वल्पं वा विपुलं वापि देयमित्यभिदीयते ॥,"That is deyam, which has been acquired by the donor himself without causing pain or loss to another or without worry of trouble to himself, whether it be small or valuable."
162,व्याख्या अपि तन्त्रस्य गुणः। ताभिरपि तन्त्रमलङि्क्रयते । ताश्च पञ्चदश प्रकारा ।,An explanation is also an attribute of a scientific composition. There are 15 types of Vyakhyas which are
163,इन्द्रो दधीचो अस्थभिर्वृत्राण्यप्रतिष्कुतः जघान नवतीर्नव,"Armed with the bones of Dadhichi, Indra was invincible and slayed hundreds of Vrtras ."
164,इछन्नश्वस्य यच्छिरः पर्वतेष्वपश्रितम् तद विदच्छर्यणावति,"Desiring the horse-head Indra roamed in the mountains, and found it at Sharnayavati. 
Dadhichi, was given the horse-head by Ashvinikumaras, who learnt Madhuvidya from him. Dadhichi received this vidya from Indra on condition that if he imparted this vidya to anyone else his head will shatter. Ashvinikumaras desirous of obtaining the vidya offered to replace his head with a horse head, through which he can impart the vidya. After receiving the madhuvidya the horse-head fell off and Ashvinikumaras replaced the rishi's original head."
165,मघवान् यात भद्रं वो दध्याञ्चमृषिसत्तमम् विद्याव्रततपःसारं गात्रं याचत मा चिरम्,"Oh Maghavaan ! Go to Dadhyancha rishi . Ask him for his body which is the personification of vidya , vrata and tapasya ."
166,स वा अधिगतो दध्यङ्ङश्विभ्यां ब्रह्म निष्कलम् यद् वा अश्वशिरो नाम यतोरमरतां व्यधात्,"Dadhyancha imparted the adhyatmik knowledge to Ashvinikumaras from the head of a horse , who then achieved immortality."
167,दध्यङ्ङाथर्वणस्त्वष्ट्रे वर्माभेद्यं मदात्मकम् विश्वरूपाय यत् प्रादात् त्वष्टा यत् त्वमधास्ततः,"Dadhyancha, the son of Atharva, delivered his invincible armor controlled by Me to Tvashtra who in turn gave it to Visvarupa. He in his turn delivered this armor of Narayana Kavacha protection to you ."
168,युष्मभ्यं याचतोऽश्विभ्यां धर्मज्ञोऽङ्गानि दास्यति ततस्तैरायुधश्रेष्ठो विश्वकर्मविनिर्मितः येन वृत्रशिरो हर्ता मत्तेजउपबृंहितः,"Upon your request the knower of Dharma , will provide his body parts to Ashvinikumaras, from whom Visvakarma will prepare an invincible weapon, invested with My power, by which Vrtrasura's head can be severed."
169,तस्मिन् विनिहते यूयं तेजोऽस्त्रायुधसम्पदः भूयः प्रप्स्यथ भद्रं वो न हिंसन्ति च मत्पुरान्,"Upon his death, you all will have the wealth of radiant weapons and will regain the good fortunes."
170,एतद्ध्येवाक्षरं ब्रह्म एतद्ध्येवाक्षरं परम् । एतद्ध्येवाक्षरं ज्ञात्वा यो यदिच्छति तस्य तत् ॥ ॥,"That which all the Vedas declare, that which all austerities utter, That desiring which they lead the life of Brahmacharya, That Word I tell thee briefly: it is Aum. That word is even Brahman; that Word is even the Supreme."
171,एतद्वै सत्यकाम परं चापरं च ब्रह्म यदोङ्कारः ।,"Verily, O Satyakama, this Omkara is the Supreme and the lower Brahman.
Brhdaranyaka Upanishad also says the following about the existence of two forms of Brahman - the Sat and Asat forms."
172,द्वे वाव ब्रह्मणो रूपे मूर्तं चैवामूर्तं च मर्त्यं चामृतं च स्थितं च यच्च सच्च त्यच्च ॥ ॥,"There are two states of Brahman, gross and subtle , mortal and immortal , finite and infinite, existent and beyond . 
This second, lower, gross, mortal, finite, existent Brahman is not ""another"" but is Brahman conditioned - therefore limited, manifesting and is thus Saguna with Attributes. The subtle formless Brahman has already been described as Nirguna Brahman."
173,अन्यच्छ्रेयोऽन्यदुतैव प्रेयस्ते उभे नानार्थे पुरुषँ् सिनीतः । तयोः श्रेय आददानस्य साधु भवति हीयतेऽर्थाद्य उ प्रेयो वृणीते ॥ ॥,"The preferable and pleasurable are indeed different things. Both of these, serving divergent purposes bind men , however, Shreya brings about wellness to him who accepts it among the two. One who chooses Preya falls down from the eternal supreme goal."
174,श्रेयश्च प्रेयश्च मनुष्यमेतः तौ सम्परीत्य विविनक्ति धीरः । श्रेयो हि धीरोऽभि प्रेयसो वृणीते प्रेयो मन्दो योगक्षेमाद्वृणीते ॥ ॥,Both wellness and pleasure are approachable to mankind
175,स त्वं प्रियान्प्रियरूपांश्च कामान् अभिध्यायन्नचिकेतोऽत्यस्राक्षीः । नैताँ् सृङ्कां वित्तमयीमवाप्तो यस्यां मज्जन्ति बहवो मनुष्याः ॥ ॥,"Oh Nachiketa! after careful deliberation you have not accepted and discarded, all the desirable things that are themselves delightful or are producers of delight. You have not accepted this path of wealth in which have many men perished."
176,दूरमेते विपरीते विषूची अविद्या या च विद्येति ज्ञाता । विद्याभीप्सिनं नचिकेतसं मन्ये न त्वा कामा बहवोऽलोलुपन्त ॥ ॥,"Yama says ""These two, and are wide apart, contradictory and follow divergent paths. A learned ascertains Avidya - as one which has objects of pleasure while Vidya - is one that has objects of knowledge. I consider that you Nachiketa are desirous of knowledge, because the desires although many were offered, did not tempt you. 
According to Sri. K. S. Narayanacharya - A Manda person is one who does not have a vision of his future. The integral knowledge that connects the past, present and the future and contemplation on such knowledge is called Pragya.Manda or dull is the opposite of Pragya. A manda desires for Yoga Kshema, unaware of his past, thinks only about the present and future. For him Yoga is achievement of the unreachable pleasures and Kshema is protecting and enjoying them all of which eventually are a cause of unlimited anxiety."
177,अविद्यायामन्तरे वर्तमानाः स्वयं धीराः पण्डितंमन्यमानाः । दन्द्रम्यमाणाः परियन्ति मूढा अन्धेनैव नीयमाना यथान्धाः ॥ ॥,"Living in the midst of ignorance and considering themselves intelligent and enlightened, the senseless ignorant persons follow about in circles adopting crooked courses, just like a blind who leads another blind."
178,न साम्परायः प्रतिभाति बालं प्रमाद्यन्तं वित्तमोहेन मूढम् । अयं लोको नास्ति पर इति मानी पुनः पुनर्वशमापद्यते मे ॥ ॥,"The other worlds attainable after the fall of the mortal body does not get revealed to a non-discerning person, whose blundering mind is attracted and deluded by the darkness of wealth and pleasures. ""This is the world"" he thinks and ""there is no other"" - thus he again and again and comes under my control."
179,य एते पितृदेवानामयने वेदनिर्मिते शास्त्रेण चक्षुषा वेद जनस्थोऽपि न मुह्यति आदावन्ते जनानां सद्बहिरन्तः परावरम् ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं वचो वाच्यं तमो ज्योतिस्त्वयं स्वयम्,"He who, through Shastric point of view, distinctly and correctly understands these paths of Pitrs and Devas as created by the Vedas, does not get deluded, even though he still abides in the physical body. For, the knower of the path factually constitutes whatever exists before the creation and after the extinction of the body; he himself is whatever is outside the body and inside the body , what is high and low, knowledge and the object of knowledge, the world and the object denoted by it, darkness as well as light."
180,अग्निः सूर्यो दिवा प्राह्णः शुक्लो राकोत्तरं स्वराट् विश्वोऽथ तैजसः प्राज्ञस्तुर्य आत्मा समन्वयात् देवयानमिदं प्राहुर्भूत्वा भूत्वानुपूर्वशः आत्मयाज्युपशान्तात्मा ह्यात्मस्थो न निवर्तते,"On his path of ascent, the progressive living entity enters the different worlds of fire, the Sun, the day, the end of the day, the bright fortnight , the full moon, and the passing of the Sun in the north, along with their presiding deities. When he enters brahmaloka that marks the highest point in the ascent of the departed atman, he enjoys life for many millions of years, and finally his material designation Vishva, where the atman identifies himself with gross matter, comes to an end. He then comes to a subtle designation called Taijasa wherein the atman merges the gross into the subtle upadhi; from which he attains the causal designation or Prajna, witnessing all previous states. Upon the annihilation of this causal state, he attains his pure state or Turiya, in which he identifies with the Supreme Self. In this way, the living entity becomes transcendental. This path is known as the path of deities . Going through these stages serially, this propitiator of the Self, being established into the Supreme Self, attains to perfect tranquility and never returns ."
181,द्रव्यसूक्ष्मविपाकश्च धूमो रात्रिरपक्षयः अयनं दक्षिणं सोमो दर्श ओषधिवीरुधः अन्नं रेत इति क्ष्मेश पितृयानं पुनर्भवः एकैकश्येनानुपूर्वं भूत्वा भूत्वेह जायते,"The gradual ascension of the departed atman is marked by the subtle modifications of materials of his astral body which is supposed to be escorted by the deities presiding over the smoke, the night, the dark half of the month, the dakshinayana , the orb of the Moon. After enjoying the fruit of his action, the path of descent of that jiva is through the New Moon day, annual plants and creepers, food grains and the semen. This is the path of Pitrs which leads to birth again. Having gone through these stages one by one, a jiva is born again in this world.
The Chandogya Upanishad further explains,"
182,तद्य इह रमणीयचरणा अभ्याशो ह यत्ते रमणीयां योनिमापद्येरन्ब्राह्मणयोनिं वा क्षत्रिययोनिं वा वैश्ययोनिं वाथ य इह कपूयचरणा अभ्याशो ह यत्ते कपूयां योनिमापद्येरन् श्वयोनिं वा सूकरयोनिं वा चण्डालयोनिं वा ॥,"By the power of dharma, karma and good conduct, through these grains, atmas accept the wombs according to a definite principle and may be born either as a brahmana, kshatriya or vaishya. Such pious people are called as ramaniya charana. 
If however their accumulated papa during the human birth is high, then they could become dog, pig or a chandala . Thus, those atmas who are attached to worldly pleasures but do not do things prohibited by Vedas attain Pitruloka. After enjoying all the accrued punya there, they return back to earth through the Pitruyana marg."
183,तदन्तरप्रतिपत्तौ रंहति सम्परिष्वक्तः प्रश्ननिरूपणाभ्याम्,"When the transmigration of the atma takes place, the living being enters into the new body along with the subtle elements - manas , buddhi and ahankara . This is corroborated in the Upanishads.
The Devayana and Pitruyana is described in the Brahmasutras in the 4th chapter , 2nd section. The mode of departure from the body up to the way is common to both the knower of the - Saguna Brahman and an ordinary man."
184,समाना चासृत्युपक्रमादमृतत्वं चानुपोष्य,And common up to the beginning of their ways
185,शुक्लकृष्णे गती ह्येते जगतः शाश्वते मते । एकया यात्यनावृत्तिमन्ययावर्तते पुनः,"These are the bright and the dark paths ; by the one he departs who does not return, by the other he who returns again."
186,अग्ने देवाँ इहा वह सादया योनिषु त्रिषु । परि भूष पिब ऋतुना ॥,"Oh Agni! Bring the devatas here and seat them in the three designated places. Decorate them and drink somarasa according to the seasons. 
Pt. Satvalekar in his Rig veda Subodh Bhashya explains the place of Agni in different parts of the body, the head, heart and the lower place of the body being the three important places."
187,दक्षिणं त्वेव प्रथमं विज्ञायते पिता वा एषोऽग्नीनां यद्दक्षिणः पुत्रो गार्हपत्यः पौत्र आहवनीयस्तस्मादेवं पर्युक्षेत्,"It is to be known that the dakshina fire should be done first, because dakshina fire is the father of all fires, garhapatya is the son and aahvaniya is the grandson. So water water should be given in this way. A few important features of the three agnis are summarized below."
188,त एव हि त्रयो लोकास्त एव त्रय आश्रमाः । त एव हि त्रयो वेदास्त एवोक्तास्त्रयोऽग्नयः । ।,"For they are declared to be the three worlds, they are the three ashramas, they the three Vedas and the three fires."
189,पिता वै गार्हपत्योऽग्निर्माताग्निर्दक्षिणाः स्मृताः । गुरुराहवनीयस्तु साग्नित्रेता गरीयसी ।।,"The father is stated to be the Garhapatya fire, the mother the Dakshinagni, the teacher the Ahavaniya fire; these three fires are most venerable."
190,त्रिष्वप्रमाद्यन्नेतेषु त्रील्लोलोकान् विजयेद्गृही । दीप्यमानः स्ववपुषाः देववद्यिवि मोदते ।।,"He who does not neglect those three, a householder, will conquer the three worlds and glows with radiance, enjoying heavenly pleasures."
191,नृयज्ञोऽतिथिपूजनम्,The honouring of Guests is offering to men .
192,कृत्वैतद्बलिकर्मैवं अतिथिं पूर्वं आशयेत् । भिक्षां च भिक्षवे दद्याद्विधिवद्ब्रह्मचारिणे । । । ।,"After having performed the Bali offering , one should first honour guests and then give alms to an ascetic and a student according to the prescribed rules."

From that was born the Sat or Existence. That Sat by itself caused Itself . That one who is self-made is verily the joy. Brahman is called the one of good deed. That which is the creator of Itself is verily the bliss. One becomes possessed with bliss gaining this Rasa!
199,असद्वा इदमग्र आसीत् । तदाहुः किं तदसदासीदित्यृषयो वाव तेऽग्रेऽसदासीत्,"Verily in the beginning there was here the Asat or non-existent. To that they say, 'What was that non-existent?'...."

Therefore, food, whether taken in reverence or otherwise, has a special place in life. Aditya or Surya, through his rays, draws out the vital essences, and Vayu gathers these and places them in the clouds. The vital essences thus collected in the clouds are showered back on the earth by Indra. Suffused with the showers, the Bhudevi, O Bharata! is verily in contentment. Out of the contented earth grow the food-crops, which sustain all life. Flesh, fat, bone, and marrow are formed of these alone."

That is why anna is said to be highest in this world. The bala and tejas of all living beings always depends upon anna.
Teaching the greatness of annadana to Yudhisthira, SriKrishna says:"
288,असुराः पणयो नाम रसापारनिवासिनः । पिवेयं तु पयस्तासां गवां यास्ता निगुहथ । असुरास्तां तथेत्युक्त्वा तदाजहुः पयस्ततः सा स्वभावाच्च लौल्याच्च पात्वा तत् पय आसुरम् ।,"Sarama by her nature not being too strong fickleness and greedy by nature was tempted by the offer of cow milk. Sarama was very appreciative of the milk and she crossed the Rasanadi and gave Indra a false report. Indra realized that Saramas report was false and wondered at the reason for the change in the character of Sarama.
Saunaka explained that Sarama changed because of influence of asuras, that is even though the milk of cows was divine, Sarama resorted to lies. Then Indra using his power kicked Sarama to get out the real truth and immediately Sarama vomited all the milk given by demons."

That samvada should be carried on with the pupil, the teacher, companions in study, and other well-known learned persons, who wish well and who are not jealous of him. In fact, being a seeker , one should carry it on even without putting forward any counter theories for the accomplishment of his purpose. For, putting forward of theories and counter theories would be unpleasant to the other person. More so if the other person in this case is a teacher. 
The bhashya explains further that,"
294,प्रमाणतर्कसाधनोपालम्भः सिद्धान्ताविरुद्धः पञ्चावयवोपपन्नः पक्षप्रतिपक्षपरिग्रहः वादः ।।।।,"Vada consists in the putting forward of a conception and a counter-conception, in which there is supporting and condemning by means of proofs and reasonings - neither of which is quite opposed to the main doctrine , and both of which are carried on in full accordance with the method of reasoning through the five factors."
295,स जल्पो वितण्डा भवति किं विशेषणः प्रतिपक्षस्थापनया हीनः ।,That Jalpa becomes Vitanda which is devoid of counter conception.
296,स्वपक्षरागेण चैके न्यायमतिवर्तन्ते तच । तत्त्वाध्यवसायसंरक्षणार्थं जल्पवितण्डे बीजप्ररोहसंरक्षणार्थं कण्टकशाखावरणवत् ॥ ॥,"Through excessive partiality to their own theories, some people transgress all bounds of reasoning; in that case, Jalpa and Vitanda should be carried on for the purpose of defending one's own determination to get at the truth; just as the hedge of thorny branches is put up for the protection of sprouting seeds.
The bhashya also clarifies further that,"
297,अनुत्पन्नतत्त्वज्ञानानामग्रहीणदोषाणां तदर्थे घटमानानामेतदिति ।,"This method however, is meant only for those persons who have not acquired True knowledge, whose defects have not been entirely removed, and who are still making an attempt for those purposes."

Yajnyavalkya answered, No, your life will be just like that of a person who is wealthy, but there is no hope of mukti through wealth.
Here Amrtattva is symbolism for mukti . It is implied here that for one whose goal is sensual pleasure, they would get only those earthly pleasures with wealth and not mukti. There is no connection between wealth and no hope of immortality through the acquisition and rites performed with wealth."
301,सा होवाच मैत्रेयी येनाहं नामृता स्यां किमहं तेन कुर्याम् । यदेव भगवान्वेद तदेव मे ब्रूहीति,"Maitreyi said, ""Hey Bhagavan, If this is so, what shall I do with that which will not make me immortal? Please instruct me on that which you know ."

It comes out as a separate entity and upon destruction enters its cause. After attaining the Self, it has no more or Name or Consciousness. This is what I say, my dear. So said Yajnavalkya.
Maitreyi asked once again , ""Hey Bhagavan, you have placed me in confusion, just here. Having stated that Self is but Pure Intelligence, and after attaining Self, it has no more Consciousness is a contradiction not comprehended by me."""

The shine of Surya is the lustre of the strength of all devatas put together. Rising sun represents the extraordinary 'eye' of devatas like Mitra, Varuna and Agni and spreads across the Dyurloka, Prithviloka and Antariksha filling the universe with his efflugence.
Taitriya Aranyaka explains"

This sun whose rays are ablaze, is the fire of the destruction of the universe. In the course of his revolution, Oh Brahmanas, he illuminates the quarters. With the mass of his rays and accompanied by the wind, the sun takes away the water of the entire world, Oh Brahmanas. The moon transmits the entire water drunk by the sun.

It is said that panis see the Sun only in this lifetime and because of their miserliness and disengagement in Yajna, they attain the land of andha tamasa or complete darkness in their future births.

The union of these three components form the tripod of life. The entire life depends and sustains on this union. It must be understood that any one of these is not sufficient to uphold the life individually.

Hence each of these 3 factors and their union hold equal importance. This union is also called as Puman or Chetan and, this is the object under discussion in Ayurveda.

400,प्रत्यक्षं ह्यल्पम्,Acharya Charaka mentions that there are limitations in obtaining the knowledge of all the elements and process happening inside the body using 5 senses of a physician. Hence knowledge obtained through 5 senses is limited whereas the knowledge that can be obtained using the method of inference is huge. This emphasizes the importance of use of Anumana pramana.
401,अथौपम्यम् औपम्यंनामयदन्येनान्यस्यसादृश्यमधिकृत्यप्रकाशनं,"The Naiyayikas accepted four valid means of obtaining valid knowledge pratyaka Pramana , anumna Pramana , Shabda Pramana and upamna Pramana . Ayurveda Samhitas mention all these 4 pramanas as means of knowledge. Upamana pramana is the tool for acquiring knowledge through the use of comparison and analogy. Use of analogy and comparison is considered as a valid means of conditional knowledge. This enables individual to identify or gain knowledge of something that is not perceivable to his five senses directly at that point of time. Ayurveda has made use of this at numerous places like while describing the body structure, organs, processes, nature of pain in a disease etc. Aupamyam is the term used in Ayurveda Samhitas to indicate Upamana pramana."
