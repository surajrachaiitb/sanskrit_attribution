One should carefully establish poetic compositions for those focused on knowledge; sacrifices, however, should be established according to rule for everyone, across all four.

A brahmana who has reached the end of the Vedas, an observer of rites, should be examined from a distance as a guest, for giving (such a one) at a tirtha is remembered as atithi."

A person who gathers people for a false funeral rite goes to a lower grade in heaven; such is the degraded Brahmin who eats the offerings at a false funeral rite. The gifts given at a false funeral rite are impure, spoken of as such by the learned. They exist here in this very world, like a cow in a blind enclosure."

Similarly, when one realizes the common attribute of these objects through comparison, their true nature is understood. For instance, when ""mudga"" (bean) and ""parni"" (its leaf) are compared, it leads to recognizing the shared characteristic of beans; then, as a result, this recognition allows one to call something else ""tamasah"" (black gram) with certainty. Likewise, when the properties of ""masha"" (lentil) and its accompanying objects are understood through comparison, it enables one to refer to similar things appropriately. In this context, ""gavayah"" is used as an example; its meaning becomes clear through the illustration, as its individual qualities are recognized by the observer (sañjnasyambandham pratipadyamana atmaoshadhim bhaishajyaya hari).

External objects are dependent on place, time, and other distinct factors. They may appear to one sense organ or another in different locations, even at a different time, or in any other place. The sphere of perception of such knowledge is determined by the locus of that perception, whether it be in the body's extremities or elsewhere. This includes experiences such as flying through the city of the gandharvas (a type of celestial being) and entering a previously seen house, among others.

The awareness of these experiences is considered to be the cause of the objects experienced, like the perception of the mrigatoya (a kind of fluid) is considered to be the cause of that substance. Similarly, the cause of the appearance of the sun is its own brightness and heat. The concept of zero is also said to arise from the absence of any particular object.

Furthermore, the meaning of words such as ""existence"" or ""non-existence,"" when fully realized, can be understood as a mental construct, even though they may appear to refer to something external. This understanding arises not only from direct experience but also from the power of reason. The objects of perception are considered to exist because of their own intrinsic nature and the causes that give rise to them, rather than being dependent on words or mental constructs alone.

In summary, this passage explores the relationship between external objects, perception, and language, emphasizing that ultimate reality cannot be reduced to mere names or concepts but is rooted in direct experience and causality."
