Just as a fire, surrounded by fuel from all sides, blazes up, so does knowledge of all the Vedas arise in the brahmin who understands their meaning.

As for your duty, perform it without attachment to its fruits, never letting the desire for reward drive you. Seeking no fruit, unburdened by possessions, do your duty, and avoid becoming attached to it."

In the absence of Agni as a dvija (""twice-born""), a priest's life acquires significance for seers during a fire ritual. In ordinary fires, there is no performance of a domestic fire ritual; it is not prescribed for the Shraddha ceremony without Darsha (a type of grass) and a dvija's presence."

One should not touch food with unwashed feet, nor harm water sources. The wrath of departed souls should not be invoked, nor should one tread on sacred formulations. On the contrary, a simple touch of the foot ensures protection from sinful and evil deeds."

This is the ancestor's heartfelt desire. He should also study the scriptures related to dharma.

In a public gathering, ""suśṛtam"" (well-known or famous) is considered agreeable. At a religious ceremony, ""sampannam"" (complete or perfected) is deemed acceptable.

Indeed, may the Vedas endure eternally. And let our faith not waver, and may bountifulness come to us. (Basic translation is correct. Enhanced translation: The brahmanas referred here are specifically those who possess the qualities of self-control and purity. The speaker asks for an increase in the givers of wealth specifically for these brahmanas. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the eternal endurance of the Vedas and seeks unwavering faith and bountifulness for themselves.)"

A thousand Rigvedic verses are consumed there where a single learned man, delighted in reciting the hymns, partakes. With diligent effort, one should feed and offer copious sacrificial gifts to the one proficient in the Vedas, having reached the conclusion of the branch, the hotar, and the Samavedic chants. The reward of that person is indeed immortal and sevenfold, for whose ancestral offering is consumed with respect and the ancestors' satisfaction becomes eternal."

One should establish works of literature for those devoted to knowledge. Sacrifices should be properly performed in all four orders without exception. 

A brahmin advanced in the Vedas should be examined from a distance, revered one. The gifting of tirtha and other sacred duties is considered as a day's hospitality."

If a father is illiterate and his son is versed in the Vedas, the father becomes learned. Likewise, if the son is illiterate, the father becomes responsible for becoming learned. Among those of equal or comparable knowledge, a learned preceptor is superior for the purpose of performing Vedic rituals. Others should be respectable."

Nor should one who knows feed a Brahmin, whether a woman or a friend, with offerings from a funeral ceremony. Indeed, one who assigns friends and offerings as a Brahmin's primary consideration at a funeral ceremony will not enjoy the fruits of rites and sacrifices in the next world. A person who conducts such a poorly performed funeral ceremony, motivated by folly, falls from heaven. The Brahmin who partakes of a funeral feast is debased, while offerings given to such lowly individuals, even by Brahmins, remain impure and remain in this world, confined like cattle in a small enclosure."

Even if a single scholar is fed modestly in divine or ancestral rites, they reap abundant fruit, not just those who recite mantras without understanding. Just as a seed, once sown, does not produce fruit unless it sprouts, so too the sacrificer does not gain fruit if offered to an unworthy recipient. Both the giver and receiver of the offering become partakers of the fruit if given to a deserving scholar, according to proper procedure, in this life and in the afterlife."

In this way, one's lifespan (āyuṣaḥ) becomes fruitful (amogham).

Among these means of prosperity are: bathing (snānam), recitation (japaḥ), fire sacrifice (homaḥ), vows (vrataṃ), and worship of gods, twice-born beings (deva dvija arcanam), as well as offerings made to ancestors and various living beings (pitṛbhūtebhyaḥ yat dattam).

The pure form of truth is to be sought, while the impure form of falsehood is to be shunned. Mortal subsistence is obtained through requesting, while immortal wealth is acquired through effort. Trade, being a combination of both, is conducted in this manner. Service, not begging, is the way one should live. Hence, one must reject begging and instead adopt service."

Moreover, even for one of two similar things, when there is a clear differentiation, it is also considered a form of valid proof known as asannikṛṣṭārthaparicchittiḥ.

For Kshatriyas, duties include governing subjects (prajānāṃ rakṣaṇam), making donations (dāna), studying (ijyādhyayanaṃ), and engaging in material activities (viṣayeṣu prasaktiḥ).
For Vaishyas, duties include looking after cattle (paśūnāṃ rakṣaṇam), trade (vaṇikpathaṃ), usury (kusīdaṃ), and agriculture (kṛṣiṃ).
For Shudras, a single duty has been assigned, service (ekaṃ tu śūdrasya prabhuḥ karma samādiśat).

Brahmanas, free from envy, are entitled to enjoy all the wealth of this world, for all riches are derived from them (śuśrūṣāṃ anasūyayā sarvaṃ svaṃ brāhmaṇasyedaṃ yatkiṃ cijjagatīgatam).
