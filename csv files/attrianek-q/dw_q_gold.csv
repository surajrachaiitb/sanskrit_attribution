Salt is considered the essence of Dyava and Prithvi, and when offered it makes the fire prosper with their essence. Where there is saltish ground they declare it fit for cattle. The earth collected from a mole hill enriches the fire with the essence of the earth. The earth is made firm and steady by the fixing of pebbles just as one would spread out a hide with pins.

Nachiketa is an exemplary example of an enlightened soul at a young age who realised that all life, without exception, is short indeed and easily turns away from temptations. He offers back all the vehicles, songs and dances offered by Yama may remain with him only. And he persists that men may rule as long as the worlds exist but that boon of knowledge of Self is worth praying for as every person wants to ascend and reach higher levels . Therefore, Nachiketa says ""O Yama! I am not to be seduced by the lure of sons, wealth, cattle and kingdoms. What are these to a sensible man who realises that worldly pleasures are transient in nature?"""

Yama being a Brahmanistha himself explains about Atma - which is difficult to understand as it is subtler than the subtlest and cannot be comprehended by any logical explanation.

In course of time, that Virat obtained a mind. That mind stood connected with each of the pores equally. And later the Panchamahabhutas were formed from it. From their combination was formed the Bhuta called ""Maha Prthvi"". It was cut into many pieces and each of the pieces was deposited in each pore. It was these Prthvi pieces which became ""Bhumis at the time of creation. During floods, these Bhumis sank again into those pores as before. In each of these Brahmandas, there are the earth, mountains, forests, oceans, the seven islands, Himavan, Meru, Sun, Moon, Stars and other lokas.

He, therefore, felt hesitant in accepting the suggestion of his wife."

The hesitation of the father-in-law in accepting this offer was perhaps the most extreme. The daughter-in-law was a mere child, who was suffering the pangs of hunger, and who had been entirely enfeebled by days and days of fasting. It was his duty, as he told her, to protect her in all respects. How could he deprive such a onewho was a child, a woman, a fasting person and an enfeebled one of her meagre food? And after all she, as the daughter-in-law, was the font of love and affection for everyone in the family. The father-in-law was indeed hesitant. But the daughter-in-law insisted, telling him that for her he as the elder of the house was both the teacher and the god. She says to her father in lawSummary: With your blessings I will attain the infinite lokas. A man attains those heavenly worlds where there is infinite happiness. Just like Dharma associate with Artha and Kama, leads one to svarga loka, and just as the three fires, Garhapatya, Ahvaniya and Dakshnagni; are instrumental in attaining svarga, so also the three kinds of progeny - sons, grandchildren and great-grandchildren lead one to the heavenly worlds filled with everlasting bliss. Pitru rna is fulfilled by the son to the father."

He collects water, gold, salts, earth , pebbles. Each of these have their significance which is explained therein. The place where the fires are to be installed are cleaned and sprinkled with water. Water is verily food, as where water is present it flourishes with food. Gold makes the fire grow with splendour, for gold is indeed the seed of fire. Salt is considered the essence of Dyau and Prithvi, and when offered it makes the fire prosper with their essence. Where there is saltish ground they declare it fit for cattle. The earth collected from a mole hill enriches the fire with the essence of the earth. The earth is made firm and steady by the fixing of pebbles just as one would spread out a hide with pins. In this manner, the yajamana keeps away his inimical rivals by making this ground firm and steady and by installing the fires on it."

Meanwhile Vrtras father, Tvashtra offered a special thunderbolt to Indra. Here Vajrayudha is described as ""tapo vy sa vajra asit"" meaning ""tapasaya"" itself is Vajrayudha "". As Indra could not lift the Vajrayudha, he prayed to Sri MahaVishnu."
307,मयि वीर्यं तत्ते प्र दास्यामीति तदस्मै प्रायच्छत्तत्प्रत्यगृह्णादधा मेति तद्विष्णवेति प्रायच्छत्तद्विष्णुः प्रत्यगृह्णादस्मास्विन्द्र इन्द्रियं दधात्विति यदन्तरिक्षे तृती॑यमासीत्तेनेन्द्रो वज्रमुदयच्छद्विष्ण्वनुस्थितः सोऽब्रवीन्मा मे प्र हारस्ति वा इदं,"Mahavisnu pleased with Indra's prayers and that of other devatas, divided himself into 3 parts "" viustrdhtmna"" .

Therefore the battle between Indra and Vrtra is symbolically very significant and must be seen from this perspective rather than the Indological historic viewpoint. The Rig veda mantras also describe the symbolism of the wars of Indra as follows Meaning 2nd line: Hey Indra! you dont have enemity with anyone, and even so how can any enemy match you? All those who say you fought wars are nothing but maya for you do not have any enemies in the past. 
Rig Veda mantras depict that Vrtra was killed and other mantras pronounce that a truce between Indra and Vrtra is established, whereby Vrtra exists in the form of hunger. In this perspective, the battle between Indra and Vrtra is eternal and Vrtra is not killed once and for all."
311,शतेषु जायते शूरः सहस्रेषु च पण्डितः । वक्ता शतसहस्रेषु दाता भवति वा न वा ॥,"According to Devala, the donor should be free from incurable or disgusting diseases, be religious, charitably inclined, free from vices, pure and following a blameless profession for livelihood.

And the maximum age to perform the Upanaya for brahmanas, kshatriyas and Vaishyas are 16, 22 and 24 years respectively. The Manusmrti also adds that the Upanayana of brahmanas desirous of attaining brahmavarchas, the splendour of which is beyond the study of Vedas and its meaning, should be performed in the 5th year, of kshatriyas desirous of strength in the 6th year and of Vaishyas desirous of prosperity in the 8th year."

Samavartana is the rite to be performed at the completion of one's education just before returning home from the preceptor's house. It is said that a brahmachari who has thus become a scholar of Vedas is offered a seat, garland of flowers and is greeted with the 'madhuparka' ritual by the father or guru."

The concept of Gurudakshina is highly respected in Bharata's Gurukula tradition. According to Manusmrti, a brahmachari who knows Dharma should not favour his teacher with offerings before learning. However, after Samavartana, he may please his guru with the offerings of field, gold, cow, horse, umbrella, sandals, seat, food, vegetables and clothes as per his ability."

Sanatkumar explains: Sankalpa is higher than mind and it is within its purview that we are able to do karma and achieve success. For when a man wills, he thinks in his mind, then through speech he utters it in Name. In the name, the mantras become one, and into the mantras, the karma merges."

The Pratyaksha pramama considers the specific aspect of the object. Chitta when affected by the external object through the path of sense-organs gives rise to a function with the specific attribute of that object. Such a function is called Pratyaksha pramana. The effect of Pratyaksha pramana ultimately is that the Purusha cognises the function of Chitta ."

Consequently Upadesha is the means of knowing dharma and it is undeviated in regard to objects not perceived by other means of knowledge. It is authoritative specially as it is independent according to Badarayana. ."
539,अपि वा कर्तृसामान्यात् प्रमाणम् अनुमानं स्यात्,"But on account of Karta being the same, inference would be that Smrti is also pramana just like the Vedas. By this sutra it can be understood that Anumana is also a pramana accepted by Mimamsakaras. ."

544,अभावोऽपि प्रमाणाभावो नास्ति इत्यस्यार्थस्यासन्निकृष्टस्य।।,"Abhava, ""negation"", ""non-apprehension"" stands for the non-existence of the means of cognition and this is what brings about the cognition that ""it does not exist"", in regard to things not in contact with the senses."

552,प्रमाणषट्कविज्ञातो यत्राऽर्थो नाऽन्यथा भवेत् । अदृष्टं कल्पयेदन्यं सा ऽर्थापत्तिरुदाहृता ॥,"On the basis of the Jaimini Sutra 4, Kumarila defines perception as a knowledge which is the result of the right functioning of the sense organs with reference to their objects. The word """" Sam is used in the sense of ""proper"" or right; and it serves to exclude out all faulty prayoga. Prayoga here means ""functioning"" of the senses with reference to their objects. In the case of the perception of silver in mother-of-pearl, the functioning of the sense-organ is faulty. In this way, this sutra may be taken as mere statement of the definition of Pratyaksha .
Kumarila's Arthapatti is defined as"
553,आनुमानिकम् अप्य् एकेषाम् इति चेन् न शरीररूपकविन्यस्तगृहीतेर्दर्शयति च ।,"The inferred entity , arrived at through Inference, is mentioned to be revealed to the followers of some recensions of the texts . The vedantin refutes this saying that the word is cognized as occurring in a simile illustrating the body. Pradhana mentioned in Katha Upanishad, is not the same as that Pradhana taught in Samkhya school. Thus through a view proposed by the opponent, the vedantin discusses the use of inference and analogy to support his siddhanta."

Many texts discuss about manifestation of beings at the start of Kalpa when all beings stream forth from the unmanifested Mulaprakrti, and at the time of Pralaya all these separated existences again dissolve back into Mulaprkrti. In the following few slokas, the coming forth of the Many is stated."

568,यज्ञं व्याख्यास्यामः। यज्ञं व्याख्यास्यामः द्रव्यं देवता त्यागः,and the Commentary by Kapardisvamin about Yajnas is as follows:
569,यज्ञः ।,Nighantu lists the fifteen synonyms of Yajna for the term Yajna in general sense though there are many features which differ among themselves.
570,सुवृत्तस्य शरीरन्तु व्यधमन्मुखवायुना । स्वयमेव जगत्म्रष्टा दक्षिणाग्निस्ततोऽभवत् ॥कनकस्य शरीरन्तु ध्मापयामास केशवः । ततोऽभूद्गार्हपत्याग्निः पञ्चवैतानभोजनः ॥घोरस्य तु वपुः शम्भुर्ध्मापयामास वै स्वयम् । तत आहवनीयोऽग्निस्तत्क्षणात् समजायत ॥एतैस्त्रिभिर्जगत् व्याप्तं त्रिमूलं सकलं जगत् । एतत् यत्र त्रयं नित्यं तिष्ठति द्बिजसत्तमाः ।,"Along with the yajnas that arose, various implements and vessels used, the items of oblation, details of structural requirements of yajna vedis were also produced from the dismembered body of Yajna-Varaha; the ladles known as sruk from the snout, sruva from the nostrils, Pragvamsha from the neck region, Istapurti and Yajurveda dharmas from the earholes, Yupas came from teeth , the Kusha-grass from the hairs of the body. From the four feet came the four rtviks , Purodasa and Charu offerings from the brain, Kakhu from the eyes, yajna-ketu from the hooves. The middle portion of the animal's body became the yajna-vedi, the back of the Varaha changed into the yajnalaya; the penis converted into the fire-pit, genital areas came forth Ajya, svadha and matra. From the heart of Varaha issued forth the yajna itself."
571,एवं यज्ञवराहस्य शरीरं यज्ञतामगात् । यज्ञरूपेण सकलमाप्यायितुमिदं जगत् ॥,"The legend in Kalika Purana further continues to narrate the origin of the agni's used in yajnas. The three associates of Varaha namely Suvrtta, Kanaka and Ghora. Brahma produced the fire Dakshinagni from Suvrtta, Vishnu produced the agni Garhapatya from Kanaka's body and Shiva produced Ahvaniyaagni from the body of Ghora. These three fires fill the entire universe; all worlds are born from them and where these agnis are tended and yajnas are conducted the devatas abide in yajna.
The important detail that one may note regarding this legend is that the yajnas came about as an act of Vishnu, as a protector, prevailing on his own Varaha form to protect Bhumi from the harm caused by the beastly form that remained at the time of ending the incarnation. Vishnu dismembered the Varaha with his own chakra bringing about the account of how the Varaha's body was transformed into a yajna and the world is founded upon it."

577,पशूनां द्रव्यहविषामृक्‌सामयजुषां तथा। ऋत्विजां दक्षिणायाश्च संयोगो यज्ञ उच्यते।। ।।,"Yajnas are of many kinds based on the different elements that go into it; such as drvyas, time of performance, the intent and phalita expected, the mantras recited, the offerings made and so on. Puranic references here are a good source of the general elements of a yajna; the Brahmanda Purana and Matsya Purana give a simple lakshana of a Yajna."
578,अयज्ञो वा एषः । योऽपत्नीकः ।,According to Taittriya Brahmana one who does not have a patni or wife cannot perform yajnas.

He was considered as an amsha of Shri Vishnu himself for fulfilling a specific purpose in this world. Bhagavata Purana and Vayu Purana extol as follows."

They do not fit higher persons nor lead to higher worlds nor bring fame . This is a SUPER Slokam of exhortation , where the Lord chides Arjuna for running away from his true calling as a warrior. THis is also a exhortation for all of us, to crush any sort of dejection and face life bravely and cheerfully with getting drenched in sorrow or misery. What is the reason for being dejected or being overcome with sorrows? It's only the mentally weak without any Aryan traits and one which does not lead to Glory or heaven indulge in such behaviour. "

But depression is not like ordinary body pain, which can be cured with a balm etc. It's something more deeper. So, Arjuna is still desolate and not convinced. In ordinary life too, we see lot of depressed people- the school or college kids commit suicide or go into depression due to scoring poorly in the exams, lovers commit suicide due to loss of a their loved ones etc - these are all decisions made out of depression and have no foundation.

The word others include Kauravas viz Duryodana and his brothers. For this Sri Krishna is posing a question seemingly. If Arjuna runs away from the war, what will he do for food and shelter? Will he live in forests? The twelve-year exile itself was considered by the Pandavas as a shame. Then how are they going to take this forest life if he ran away from the war? Sri Krishna apparently asks this and so Arjuna s reply is accordingly in sloka 5: ""Arjuna says it is better for him to beg and live rather than killing great personalities like Bhishma and his guru Drona."
612,कार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः पृच्छामि त्वां धर्मसम्मूढचेताः । यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे शिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम् ॥ ॥,"whether winning or losing is better for us. When not interested to live by killing these children of Dhridhrashtra, the same persons are arrayed against us . Bhagavat Gita has a reputation that a recitation of a chapter or half of it or a sloka in a chapter or half or even quarter of a sloka will accumulate punya. This is to emphasize that every word in this sacred text is rich and brimming with significance."" Arjuna says he is torn between what to do , he doesn't know what to do . He is in Dharma-Sankatam - i.e choosing between the two dharmas - Being a Kshatriya and fighting or invoking paap of killing his acharya. With this plaguing doubt, he says, even winning is not guaranteed in this war . And even if he is ready to fight, listening to Krishna, he sees his gurus, relatives etc arrayed against him in the war, the very people whom he does not want to kill! Arjuna expresses his quandry here. Like all of us, he is caught in a dilemma of what is right or wrong and what is better. With this quandry, he also has doubts on his winning the war. He doesn't wish to kill his guru and close relatives, but they are arrayed against him in the war which he has to Win! Arjuna is thrown into despair. This is akin to the dilemma of a Father who wants to ensure his wayword Son reigns his habits to write the exam, but if he physically assaults him to control, then the son ends up not writing the exam due to being incapacitated."

Killing relatives and annihilating a dynasty or family is a paap, which will lead to eradication of kula dharma and so take him to hell. Enjoyment cannot be with blood stained hands. Even if the enemy camp was ready, killing near ones is paap. The very sight of these people ready to fight dries up
his senses. Even if a prosperous, entire world or heaven is offered to rule, Arjuna can never think of fighting. "

617,न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः । न चैव न भविष्यामः सर्वे वयमतः परम् ॥ ॥,"not go away. Krishna says that Arjuna's lamentations in the previous verses display somebody who speaks like a learned person but is truly lamenting like a fool. Who is considered learned? A panditah? One who knows and understands that body and soul are not the same and acts accordingly is the truly learned one in this world. And not the material experts or people who know the sciences and other aspects of material universe. In some of the earlier verses, Arjuna seems to recognize this difference. "

Similarly, there is a difference between Jeevatma and Paramatma along this three bedhams. Paramatma and jeevatma both have intelligence or gyana, but the jeevatma s intelligence is limited by the body it resides. So, here we see sajatiya bedam. Bramham or Paramatma has wisdom and the objects and materials we see do not possess any intellect. This is vijatiya bedam. As God cannot be worshipped if there was no form or He did not possess qualities like mercy, Bramham has forms and qualities and so here the swagata bedam is exhibited. "

A brave person is not concerned by such a change."" We have seen that Bramham, Chit and Achit as the thatvathrayam and their relationship and differences. Sri Krishna tries to clear the doubt in Arjuna s mind and tells that Atman is eternal and cannot be destroyed. Body is required and we have to take care of it to the extent possible and the perishable nature of it has to be kept in mind. "
620,यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ । समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते ॥ ॥,"between the organs and the matter happiness, sorrow, heat and cold are felt. This cannot be avoided and inevitable. Similarly, in a fight such pains are inevitable and with that knowledge Arjuna is advised to bear the sufferings. Every person will have to endure what he must . A brahmin or priest who does rituals has to observe severe austerities , suffer from hunger and thirst till the ritual is completed. Similarly what arjuna is doing is a ritual a ritual for justice . Besides , arjuna is the son of kunti whose fore fathers were great warriors. Arjuna is the descendant of bharatha , another great warrior ."
621,नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः । उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ॥ ॥," "" O great of men , The courageous look at their sorrow as happiness itself. One who remains unshaken by the emotions springing out of pleasure or pain is fit for eternity.""In the 14th sloka, we saw that the connection with organs and elements creates sorrow or happy feelings. Every doubt expressed here is on behalf of us by Arjuna. He asks why should one bear these twins, happy and sorrow or cold and heat? By getting hurt in this fight, if we are to get any benefits we can bear that pain. Or, if it promises a better world after death also we can tolerate this pain. But the pain is unbearable here and by killing relatives and teachers only hell is assured, so this fight appears to be avoidable, says Arjuna. Arjuna questions, WHY should he bear al the pain?? Is he going to get ""return"" in this world for bearing the pain?? Or is he going to be benefited in a future life ? Arjuna says, he is only guaranteed Narakam by killing his elders in future and in this life he is only going to get pain. So, why should he battle?? Krishna responds: ""DhIram"" A DhirAm is one who remains poised , patient, unruffled under any circumstance, whether it is joy or sorrow is a true ""KarmaYogi"" . For eg: Swami Vivekananda gives an example that a KarmaYogi is one who remains the same in Busy city market or a desert in the same way. The Courageous deem their suffering as inevitable as pleasure itself. To them the waves of pleasure and pain are unavoidable. Therefore they perform their duties assigned to them righteously without an eye on the result or fruit of such exercise. Such action , to them is a means to immortality . O Arjuna , Only a person who is unfazed by any contact, hard or soft such as those resulting from the use of weapons in war , etc; is destined to immortality . You ,being the great of your men , look unable to bear grief . This is not the behaviour of the courageous. The body is bound to perish. The soul is invincible and never loses its existence . So the wise do not grieve for the body that has been already predestined to perish. They don't grieve for the soul as its devoid of death . This much was asserted in 2.11 . The Lord further advised Arjuna in the previous verse to remain undisturbed by pleasure or pain . The reason for adopting the mental state of treating pleasure and pain equally is now put forward. The Lord describes the mental state of the courageous who have nothing to attain but immortality , and hence are not worried about pain or pleasure. And a Person who acts in such a way, is blessed with Liberation. What is this ""Amrutatvaya"" which Krishna refers here? It is not ""Swargam"" or ""Narakam"" . Liberation is beyond Swargam and Narakam i.e eternal Kaimkaryam to the Lord in Vaikuntam. Pain and Pleasure is constantly arriving and departing in life. The same thing which gives pleasure also gives pain beyond a certain point or in a different situation. eg. In Cold , we wear sweater, blanket etc , but the same blanket etc is thrown out in Summer. Similarly, foods which seems bitter, tasteless etc are normally good for health. Now, how can be a ""DhIran""?? It is the Lord's grace and one's sense of purpose to follow that path. For eg: Freedom fighters in the past bore great pain without demur, which we cannot imagine going through in normal circumstances. Why? Because, they had the great sense of purpose to sacrifice and suffer. The word purusham does not mean male, but atman. Our body is called puri and the one who is dwelling in that puri is purusha. The soul is not different for males and females."
622,अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः । अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत ॥ ॥,"That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul."" Krishna explains in this sloka , why the Atma is eternal and never perishes. In the 16th sloka He told about the everlasing nature of the soul and the fleeting nature of the body. In this sloka He gives the reason for the eternity of the soul and in the 18th sloka the reasons for the perishable quality of body. In this sloka, krishna says that which pervades the body is indestructible. He refers to Soul as unperishable. No one or Nothing can destroy the soul. Why? That's the inherent nature of the soul. Note: The allusion here is that there are NUMEROUS Souls! The soul in one body is different from the soul in another body. This disputes the ""Advaitic"" theory of only One Soul. ANother intresting thing to note is, Krishna says only a ""subtlel"" element only destroys a ""grosser"" element and not in the reverse. For eg: An arrow or a Bullet which is Sukshmam annhilates a Sthulam eg. Man, Elephant etc. But, not the reverse. Using this logic, since Soul is the smallest atom i.e most subtle , there is nothing or anybody which can perish it, so it is Eternal! THis is the reasoning Krishna mentions here to support the assertion that Soul is eternal. Know that the self in its essential nature is imperishable. The whole of insentient matter, which is different , is pervaded by the self. Because of pervasiveness and extreme subtlety, the self cannot be destroyed; for every entity other than the self is capable of being pervaded by the self, and hence they are grosser than It. Destructive agents like weapons, water, wind, fire etc., pervade the substances to be destroyed and disintegrate them. Even hammers and such other instruments rouse wind through violent contact with the objects and thereby destroy their objects. So, the essential nature of the self being subtler than anything else, It is imperishable. Agents like fire , water or wind pervade the substances and cause destruction. Striking objects are guided by force cutting the air . Destruction is caused by forces which are subtle essentially. The destroyed objects are gross and manifest.So for destruction to be effected , the destroying agent must be subtler than the object destroyed. The soul is subtler than everything else . Hence it is free of destruction. That is, only sookshmam , is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its adhyatmik influence is exhibited."" In Tatparya Chandrikai, Swami Desikan says that it's true that Jeevatma is more subtle and Sukshmamam and nothing can destroy it. But, isn't Paramaatma is more subtle than Jeevatma. Shastras says that Paramaatma is "" Anoraniyan, MahatoMaHiyaan, Atmauhaayaam ..."". So, can't Paramatma be the reason for destroying Jeevatma?? Atleast potentially? Nammazhwar says ""Udal Misai Uyir Enna, Karand Engum Parand Ulan ...."", which confirms that Paramatma is inside every Jeevatma. Now the question arises, can't Paramatma destroy Jeevatma?? This causes a dilemma! If we say, Paramatma can destroy Jeevatma, then it negates the fact that Jeevatma is indestructible! But, if we say Paramatma cannot destroy Jeevatma, then it negates the fact that Paramatma is ""Sarva Shakti"" . Swami Desikan says that ""Paramatma"" definitely has the capability to destroy ""Jeevatma"", since he is Bhagavan. But, Paramatama has taken ""Sankalpam"" NOT to destroy Jeevatma. {Satyam Satyam Punah Satyam! Udbrhishta Bhujam Uchyateh!... )"
623,य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम् । उभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते ॥ ॥,"In the last slo:ka , it was clearly established that the soul is to be eternal . In this slo:ka it is being ascertained on the pillars of the holy scriptures that the body which houses the soul is inherently prone to destruction . Basically the arguments in this slo:ka and the last are soul-centric. While the last slo:ka explains the soul's nature of being undestroyed , this one puts across a view of contrasting the eternal nature of soul with the property of destruction inherently dwelling in the body . Hence the Lord advises , ""Grieve not . Fight!"" now says that the bodies are perishable and the reason for it. The very nature of Body is perishable. He gives three reasons for it in this sloka. The immeasurable and
indestructible soul gets a perishable body as per it's Karmas. The Soul is eternal . Note: Immeasurable i.e aPrameyasya means something which cannot be comprehended or measured . Ime -> all these i.e which we can see. What? This is the PanchaBhootam out of which Body is made. Anything which is made of panchaBhootam is destructible . Whereas, Soul is made of Gnaanam and is eternal. dehAh -> Upachayam and Apachayam. Body is subject to growth and decay. Body has external features like legs, hands,eyes, ears, nose etc, unlike Atma. Atma is sukshmam and is unchanged. The term deha meaning body is derived from the word dih meaning to increase and correspondingly those bodies having increase must also have decrease and therefore are of a perishable nature. The elements combine to form the body dictated by karma ato render seva to the imperishable soul to enable the living entity to experience the positive and negative fruits of their actions. In the Brihad- aranyaka Upanisad it is stated: by accruring merit one becomes meritorious. A living entity is forced to accept a body only until all ones positive and negative karma is exhausted and then the physical body is no longer bound to exist in the physical plane. Sareerinah, Sarirah -> Sareeram is by it's very nature subject to decay, because it's purpose to exhaust the good and bad karmas of Jeevatma. The body is called de:ha , Sari:ra etc; This principally qualifies that the body is composed of parts . As it is composed of parts , destruction or damage of individual parts means destruction of body. Further , the body is understood to be composed of five elements . As new matter cannot be created from nothingness , its the elements that have transformed into body . To rediscover the elements , its only imperative that the body shed into its elements . Hence , the passing existence of the body is beyond doubt or debate . "
624,न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः । अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे ॥ ॥,"There is nothing or anybody which can destroy a soul. A soul cannot be killed nor is there anything which can destroy a soul. Thus a Soul is eternal. The two types of people, i.e one who thinks there is something which kills this Atma or that Soul gets killed, are ignorant. Whoever doesn't understand this, doesn't have true knowledge. Now, a moral dilemma arises. In shastras, there are statements which advices us not to treat and kill other Jeevas . But, here Krishna says that a Soul can never be destroyed or killed by anybody or anything. Isn't it contradictory? Does the Shastras means ""Body"" shouldn't be injured and not refers to Soul? Not really, since after the soul leaves the body, body perishes by itself. The reason is, when Shastras warn us not to mistreat or harm other creatures, it means that we shouldn't ""separate"" a body and it's soul, because we have no right to do it!! . We may think, perhaps the shastras only ask us not to kill the bodies of other creatures. When Veda says cow slaughter should be avoided, does it mean the body of the cow should not be hurt? This is also not correct. Because, when someone dies, the body is cremated by igniting fire to the body. None calls this as himsa or hurting. So the shastras instruct us not to harm a body which is living or when the soul is inside. Therefore, the implication is that one should not cause maranam . Maranam means mruth prana thyagena. That is separation of atman from the body and the Vedas advise us not to do this separation. So, the correct interpretation of the shastras is that, we are not authorized to separate the soul from the body. "
625,वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनमजमव्ययम् ।कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम् ॥ ॥,"""For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He was not born at the time of kalpa, does not disappear at the end of kalpa. He is unborn, eternal, unchanging and very ancient. He is not slain when the body is slain."" The soul never takes birth or dies. The soul is unborn , beyond destruction , without any changes in their intrinsic state and remains FRESH even after being many ages old. It is not formed at the beginning of creation and it is not destroyed at the end of this world. The soul remains even as the body perishes. Soul is -> ""ajah:"" , ""Nitya:"", ""Sasvatah:"", ""Puranah"" ), forever. The word purana means ancient. Etymologically it stems from purapi navah meaning old yet new illustrating that the eternal soul although ancient is experienced with every birth as ever new. Thus it has been clarified that the physical body only perishes but never can the eternal soul perish. The 17th sloka dealt with the reasoning that since there is not a smaller entity than the atman, it is indestructible. In the 18th sloka, since the body was a composite of the five elements and since it was growing and waning, it is destroyable. In the 19th sloka, it was told that he, who does not understand this true nature of atman and body, is not a wise man. Having stated so, now in the 20th sloka, Sri Krishna establishes that atman does not undergo any changes whatsoever. In this slokam, Krishna says that Soul is not only eternal and indestructible, but it is not subject to any change, at ANY time. This is to address the doubt Arjuna had on whether the Soul was ""indestructible and not subject to change"", just now or in last 1000 years and probably it has a ""manufacturing and expiry"" date?. Krishna says emphatically that soul is ""ALWAYS"" eternal, unborn, without death and unchanging. Now, we will have a doubt. In shastras, it is mentioned that the lifespan of a human is less than Devas , which is less than Brahma etc.. . 4 Yugas = 4,320,000 years * 1000 is the span of Brahma for one kalpa, when Shrusti and Pralayam takes place. Krishna says here, that Soul is never born or dead during any of this times, whether it is Shrusthi, Pralayam, Kalpa or a human life span!! Now, another question arises, since the souls are eternal, are we Paramatma?? No, Jeevatmas are separate from Paramatma. Due to ignorance and material contact, we have lost this true knowledge. Based on our karmas, the soul takes bodies accordingly. In an inanimate object, also soul exists, but it has no way to increase it's understanding. Beyond, inanimate objects is trees, then animals, then human, then devas etc. When it acheives true knowledge, it reaches ""paramapadam"" to live eternally with Paramatma. Each of this body, gives the soul a potential to gain the true nature of itself. Soul is not subject to the six types of change, like body! But, intrestingly, even though Soul is eternal, it appears to be changing as per the body it takes.It's similar to we wearing different types and colors of dresses every day! Even though we are the same person, our external appearance seems to change as per the dress we wear! This Self is destitute of the six types of transformation or Bhava-Vikaras such as birth, existence, growth, transformation, decline and death. As It is indivisible . It does not diminish in size. It neither grows nor does It decline. It is ever the same. Birth and death are for the physical body only. Birth and death cannot touch the immortal, all-pervading Self. The understanding that the eternal soul is never slain is being confirmed by its freedom from the six changes of material existence being: birth, existence, growth, modification, decay and death which are controlling all living entities high and low in the material existence. The Supreme Lord by declaring the eternal soul is not born confirms the absence of any birth and by declaring the eternal soul does not die confirms the absence of any destruction. "
626,वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि । तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णान्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही ॥ ॥,"O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, eternal, unborn and immutable kill anyone or encourage anyone to kill?"" Tirumangai Azhwar says in Thirunedundantakam - Munuru, Pinuru, Ponuru . "" .. Irrapaturuku enathu!"". Paramatma is embedded inside every Jeevatma and Jeevatma is in every material body. One who knows the true nature of soul is eternal understands that he cannot destroy or kill anybody, nor will be make an attempt to kill. Krishna says this to Arjuna to ensure that if he knows this truth, he will understand that he cannot kill Bhishma, Drona etc. Atma is inside Shareeram, temporarily. Soul is ""AJAM"" ., NITYAM, AVINASINAM , ""AVYAYAM"" . Whoever realises this gnaanam , CANNOT kill anybody and neither will he even attempt to kill i.e ""Katam cha purushah paartha!"". There are two types of Tattvam - ParaaDarsham, PratyaDarsham. Achit are all Paraaa Darsham. Whereas, human, animal etc is all ""PratyaDarsham"", because we all have the feeling of ""I"" , which is ""Self-illuminating"". So possessing adhyatmik intelligence, knowing the soul to be eternal, understanding it to be birthless and deathless being of an inexhaustible nature how is it possible for anyone to commit any act of destruction against the immortal soul which dwells in trillions of various and diverse living entities among the 8 million 400 thousand species of life throughout the billions of material universes. Whom can anyone destroy? How can anyone destroy anyone? Who can cause anyone to be destroyed? No one can! Thus it can be seen that ignorance of the eternal nature of the soul is the cause of all grief by not understanding that the soul is immortal and thinking that the eternal soul perishes when the physical body perishes. Comprehending that what happens to the immortal soul when the physical body ceases to function is factually the withdrawal from an old physical body to enter into a new physical body. So it can be understood that those who have deep regret for the loss of the physical body, serving as it does as the facility for securing and enjoying material pleasures; these living entities should reflect on the futility and temporal nature of material existence rather than trying to eternally exploit their senses. Yaksha poses this question to DharmaPutram in Mahabharat - ""What is the most wonderful-AAshcharyam thing in this world""?? Yudishtra replies that ""even though this body has 9 holes, the Jeevatma doesn't fly away and still resides in this body!.. that is the most amazing thing in this world"" . Body is ""NavaDwara Pura patnam"". Yaksha poses another question: ""What is even more amazing""? Yudishtra replies that ""Seeing so many people die also, a person still thinks he is going to live forever. For eg: Even the pallbearers plan to make a living by carrying dead!"". So it is very difficult to come to that realization that the atman is everlasting and the body only perishes. ""As a person puts on new garments, giving up used up ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones."" Arjuna has a doubt now, after hearing Krishna mentioning that Atma is Nityam, Indestructible etc , body is temporary and will fall and that one has to bear the pain to achieve the goal. But, human has an attachment by nature with his body, due to the association of being in it. It's natural! So, isn't it normal to show attachment to a body which has given us company throughout the life and not show any dukham to it's demise or destruction?? In response Krishna mentions that Slokam. He says that rather than showing Dukham at the demise of the body, one should express joy! He says, just like a man wears new garments and throws off worn out garments, similarly the Jeevatma casts off one body and takes another. \"
627,नैनं छिन्दन्ति शस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावकः । न चैनं क्लेदयन्त्यापो न शोषयति मारुतः ॥ ॥ अच्छेद्योऽयमदाह्योऽयमक्लेद्योऽशोष्य एव च । नित्यः सर्वगतः स्थाणुरचलोऽयं सनातनः ॥ ॥,"""As a person puts on new garments, giving up used up ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones."" Arjuna has a doubt now, after hearing Krishna mentioning that Atma is Nityam, Indestructible etc , body is temporary and will fall and that one has to bear the pain to achieve the goal. But, human has an attachment by nature with his body, due to the association of being in it. It's natural! So, isn't it normal to show attachment to a body which has given us company throughout the life and not show any dukham to it's demise or destruction?? In response Krishna mentions that Slokam. He says that rather than showing Dukham at the demise of the body, one should express joy! He says, just like a man wears new garments and throws off worn out garments, similarly the Jeevatma casts off one body and takes another. So, isn't it a cause for joy rather than sorrow? So, rather than feeling sorrow of casting away old body and taking new, it should be joyous occasion. In Taittraya Upanishad "" Yuvasya .. athisthio... Maanusha Anandah"", it says that Youth is the ultimate fountainhead of happiness for human life and when this body has overlasted it's usefulness, so isn't it a joy to shed it? Now, Arjuna had another doubt - If at the end of this life, one gets a worst body e.g. animal etc due to past karmas, isn't it a scary thought? i.e if one gets to wear rags, it would be preferable to wear an old shirt, rather than shedding it and wearing a rag. Krishna says that, Arjuna need not fear, since he is fighting a battle doing his Kshatriya duty and even if he perishes in the battle, he is assured of swargam. So, he need not worry about the next life. Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mundaka Upanisad, as well as the Svetasvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds--although they are the same in quality-- one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Krsna is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the
cause of one's changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another. The jiva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme adhyatmik master--as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto Krsna for instruction-- the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Katha Upanisad and Svetasvatara Upanisad confirm this: samane vrkse puruso nimagno 'nisaya socati muhyamanah justam yada pasyaty anyam isam asya mahimanam iti vita-sokah ""Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His glories--at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties."" Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Krsna, and is understanding the Bhagavad-gita from Him. And thus, hearing from Krsna, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation. ""The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor dried by the wind."" ""This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same."" "
628,अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयमविकार्योऽयमुच्यते । तस्मादेवं विदित्वैनं नानुशोचितुमर्हसि ॥ ॥,"""The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor dried by the wind."" ""This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same."" The concept of indestructibility of the soul that was already spoken from 11 to 17 is being reiterated here for the sake of emphasis. Soul cannot be cleaved, burnt, wetted or dryed by weapons, fire, water and air respectively. It is not capable of being pervaded by them and cleaving, burning, wetting and drying are actions which can take place only by pervading a substance. Krishna says the same thing in both verses 23 and 24, only with a different wording. Why?? Because, this is important and he wants to reemphasize the truth of such import, by repeating and stressing on it. No Weapons can cut this soul! Fire cannot burn this soul! Water cannot drown or destroy this soul! Air cannot dry or destroy this soul! Why? Because soul is pervaded inside everything! Now a question will arise - Isn't this pervasion, omnipresence a characterisitic of only Paramatma?? Not really. Paramatma is indeed omnipresent, but Jeevatma also has pervasion. The significant difference is that, numerous jeevatmas pervaded throughout the substances of this world and at any single time, single place, a jeevatma can only pervade only one place, unlike Paramatma who pervades across space, time and place. Now, Arjuna has another doubt. Ok, a soul cannot be cut, burnt or destroyed in any way. But, will a soul will subject to perishment over course of time? Will it change its nature, svabhavam over time?? Krishna says NO. Self is eternal. It is Stable, Immovable and primeval . Another important point here is that Krishna says Self is always having knowledge and it doesn't change or get any new knowledge. What makes humans and other beings behave differently is due to this knowledge being hidden or covered due to karmas, just like a Sun gets temporarily obscured by clouds. Though the two slokas appear to be repetitive, the 23rd sloka talks of implements, if any, to destroy atman and the next sloka says the atman is indestructible. It is our experience in our schools also that important points are reiterated by teachers so that they are remembered always. Here, Sri Krishna also a Teacher par excellence, wants Arjuna to remember these noble qualities of atman, and so reiterates. This will clear any doubts Arjuna has. In the first place, He says that no weapons are there to cut the atman. Fire cannot burn it. Water cannot wet it. Here it should be understood that the atman couldn t be dissolved by water. Air cannot dry it. In the next sloka Sri Krishna says about the everlasting nature of atman, which we had seen earlier. But, in addition He makes another statement that atman is pervading or permeating all over. We have heard that only Paramatma or God only is all pervading and omni present. How, then, atman can have this quality? The interpretation by elders is that when an atman is in a body, by its power of wisdom or knowledge it is pervading in the entire body without a gap. Same atman when takes another body as its residence, pervades that body fully. Like this many bodies are fully pervaded by the atman, at different times. This is a major difference between the Paramatma and the Jeevatma. While, the former permeates all bodies always and simultaneously, the latter occupies different bodies at different times. It is said that certain yogis have that power to have their atman present in more than one body at the same time. Normally, atman is present in one body only. Arjuna accepts that it is all right the atman cannot be dissolved by water or burnt by fire and so on, but it is possible, he doubts, that the atman might fade on its own and disappear. Sri Krishna says that the eternalness is natural to atman. Still not convinced, Arjuna feels that the atman may change its characters with time. He wants to know whether atman s swabhavam or characteristics undergo change. Sri Krishna says that the swabhavam of atman is gyana or intellect. In other words it is gyana swaroopy, a personification of wisdom. This never changes. A fresh doubt comes in the mind of Arjuna. We find knowledge is neither uniform nor complete and we take efforts to develop. So how it is justified to say that the knowledge of soul is not changing? Our elders have explained this. All atman have total wisdom but when in a body, the knowledge exhibited is limited by the past karmas. So the brightness is reduced by the karmas. We dig the earth at a place for water. Water gushes out. Water was already present there and by digging at the right place the water sprang up. Similarly, the gyana or knowledge is already in the soul and by our efforts we try to bring out and become more knowledgeable. Like Sunshine being reduced by the clouds or the umbrella. So, the atman s gyana is also permanent."
629,जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युर्ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च । तस्मादपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥ ॥,"""If, however, you think that the soul is always born and dies forever, you still have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed."" In the previous slokas, Krishna emphasized the body is different from Soul and says to Arjuna not to worry about this temporary body and fight in the war. . But in this sloka and the next two slokas, Krishna indulges in ""Adbhukgamavadam"" , where he changes tact , In this you argue your point agreeing with the point what your opponent is imagining. So, Sri Krishna argues assuming that the body and soul are same, as thought by Arjuna. If both are same also Arjuna should not mourn at the killing of Bheeshma or Drona. Because, as the body falls, the soul also dies according to the assumption of Arjuna. He should not now worry where the soul is going, to hell or heaven, as the soul is no longer there after the body is slain. So, here he says, Arjuna .. Ok, even if you consider Atma is identical with body and is ""NityaJatam"" and ""NityamMurtam"" , even then , you should not feel grief. Why? The only constant in this body is CHANGE! We don't always remain a kid, a boy,a youth or so on. Even things around us, change constantly! Now, Arjuna says, he is not worried about change, but death. Krishna says, why worry about death? Arjuna says, he is worried to be separated from everybody or others separating and the unknown stage after death. Krishna laughs and says, if Arjuna is considering body and soul as one and the same, what is there to worry about death, because once the body perishes, it's the end of body and soul! This is a good example of how ignorance can cloud us with fear. For e.g. when we get hurt etc, we are scared, but the expert Medics are calm and repair us without any fear. A surgeon is not scared to operate or seeing blood etc, but we are scared. Why? Because the surgeon is an expert. This shows that ignorance is the root of this fear. Another reason is ""experience"".. Lack of awareness is also another reason for fear. For eg. if we are familiar with a misery or a disease etc, it is no longer a reason for fear. So, if Arjuna thinks body and soul are one and the same, change is inevitable and there is no reason to worry. Similarly, the question of Swargam, Narakam doesn't arise, because if Arjuna considers body and soul are one and the same, there is no swargam, Narakam. Arjuna now has another doubt - ""We"" know the change in One body i.e from infant to old age, but when we shed one body and take another body, we are not aware of the old body and that is a reason for fear, since the past and future are unknown. Krishna responds that, if we remember every past life, then we will end up being inundated with past memories and past relationships, which will end us drowned in samasaram, without any chance of redemption. Only great yogis and gnaanis have this power of rememberance, since it doesn't disturb them. So, Krishna says that birth and death are inevitable for the body, whose nature is modification and there is no need to feel grief. Krsna sarcastically addressed Arjuna as maha-bahu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhasikas , which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a ksatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles. ""One who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one is sure to take birth again. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament."" Krishna says that whatever is originating, it's destruction is certain and whatever is perishable, it will inevitably originate. Arjuna now has a doubt. If he wins the war and whatever is born is going to perish, it means the win will also be temporary. So, why even battle?? Similarly, shouldn't a person who has recuperated from disease is happy, should he be, because his recuperation is ultimately temporary? Krishna responds saying that, this efforts are required for clearing of the trouble for that period, which is natural and there is no confusion or wrong about it. Similarly, it's Arjuna's responsibility to fight his way from the current situation, rather than running away. Now another doubt comes up - Is something coming up from nothing or is it coming up from something; This two types of arguments are called - Sat-kaarya Vaadham and Asat-kaarya Vaadham. e.g. To take an analogy, it's the difference between Discovery and Invention. Discovery is something which is already there and been identified for use . Invention is creating something which was not there previously . But, really speaking, the components of telephone was always there and it's only been arranged in a new way. e.g Wool.Thread strung together becomes a Cloth. Similarly, something can come out of something and nothing and when it perishes, it doesn't go away. but is transformed. eg. when a pot is broken, even though the Pot is destroyed, it creates the clay . Similarly, when a body perishes, it takes a different form. It is evident that death of the physical body is inevitable to whatever is born and that there is no way to escape from this physical termination of the body. Similarly rebirth is unavoidable once one's physical body has died. How can something which has been lost become again? It is conceivable that something which has already been to become again; but it is inconceivable for that which has never been to become. Therefore there is nothing that can come that has not been. What is known as birth and death is but just different modifications of an ever existing condition. "

It is conceivable that something which has already been to become again; but it is inconceivable for that which has never been to become. Therefore there is nothing that can come that has not been. What is known as birth and death is but just different modifications of an ever existing condition. Yarn and other materials exist but when they are woven into a fabric that is a particular arrangement of the yarn itself, it receives the name cloth in its modified state. Even the asat-karya-vadis who follow the fallacious hypothesis that existence comes from non-existence should admit the ever existing state, for what we know as cloth to them is a new creation but is factually the same old yarn only in a new form which has been created. It is not sagacious or well thought out to assume that a new substance has come into being simply because of a modified condition. Thus coming into existence and disappearing from existence are modified states of an ever existing reality. One of the conditions of this modified state is its appearance called birth and another condition being its diametric opposite is known as death which by disappearing this ever existing reality passes into. For a substance which is intrinsically metamorphic the process of modification is essential. As in the case of a clod of earth, transformed into clay, transformed into a pot, transformed into dust and transformed back to earth again. The manifestation of a subsequent condition is but a modification of a previous condition and that same subsequent condition becomes a prior condition of another subsequent condition. Reasoning in this way it can be understood that it is natural that successive modifications take place in regards to creation and destruction of physical bodies which cannot be avoided and there is no reason to lament due to this. If there is some slight grief which may be apparent by the passing from a prior modified state to a subsequent modified state even this grief need not arise in the case of living entities such as human beings because... and the next verse 28 clarifies why.""The body is not capable of revealing the past middle revealed. Future not revealed, Oh! Bharatha, where is then need for grief?"" All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation? Note, slokas 26,27,28 are all based on the assumption that body and soul are the same and Krishna presenting that even assuming this false assumption is true, even then one should not get disturbed by the death or destruction of this body. Take for eg: Pot, clay, mud are three different forms of the same thing and one thing transforms into another in it's cycle of formation and destruction. Atleast for Pot, we know what form it will take , when it gets broken. But, for human, we wouldn't know for sure what it's future state be, after death. After death, it may take a better form. Arjuna asks, whether it's possible to know what the past or future states would be? Krishna responds that, we won't know our past or future, but only our present. This body which is made up of PanchaBhootams is ""Avyaaktaani"" in the past; Our current state is known ; Our future i.e after death is unknown. So, there is no point in grieving about the future stage. Do remember that this sloka is based on the assumption that body and soul are same and Krishna is presenting it from this point of view and letting Arjuna know, even with this assumption, there is no point in grieving about future or past. Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument's sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested.

632,देही नित्यमवध्योऽयं देहे सर्वस्य भारत। तस्मात्सर्वाणि भूतानि न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥ ॥,"In the previous three slokas, Krishna expatiated about not being concerned about Body and how it is temporary. Arjuna is now baffled that he is unable to comprehend this reality and is still scared. All of us are in the same boat, including the great Jnaanis, even though the jnaanis are in a higher plane of understanding. The power of this bodily conception is very difficult to overcome. Krishna responds to this fear of Arjuna: This amazing nature of soul is known/seen by only one among crores and only one among crores talks about it and then only one among crores hears about it and then only one among crores will really understand and realise the soul exists and that body is temporary. This shows that it's only the rare among the beings that truly realises the Atma and not everybody can get away from this bodily allure and conception. Sri Krishna says that one in a crore see atman, one in a crore only hear about atman and one in a crore only talk about him. But it is much more rare to find a person who understands atman. This may cause a doubt in us that there is no one knowing about atman. So there is nothing like atman. Because, if anything exists, then at least some persons should know about it. We talk of Mount Everest. Very few persons would have seen it. From them we understand it is there. We believe an object only if someone who had seen the object tells us. So, Arjuna doubts whether there is an atman, as nobody has seen it. Sri Krishna replies that He did not say there was no one who had seen the atman, but it is very, very rare to find a person who had seen atman. Such a person is a noble one, who can be followed. This second chapter unlike the first one is quite difficult to follow, for everyone learning Gita. Because the soul is abstract and it has no form to recognize nor are there any similar substance in the world to identify. But constant studies and thinking can slowly make us to understand. We are able to conceive God, as many forms are available. But for atman there are no icons. A beginning is now made and by continuous efforts we can refine our knowledge about atman. We shouldn't get distressed by this! How to overcome this rarity?? Our lives are totally consumed by material being. It needs dedication to reflect about our selves , focus our efforts on it and be dedicated. For eg: if a boy is given to solve a PHD maths problem, he cannot solve it. He needs to complete schooling, Graduate, masters, PHD, before he can solve it. But, at the same time, if he reached adult age, it doesn't mean that he can solve it, unless he is in the Maths field. So, this requires not only ""age"" & experience, but to study in that field. Similarly, in our lives, we need continued focus in the reflection of the truth about atma to understand this truth. Simply, by living in material life and diving once in a while into adhyatmik pursuit isn't going to help. When we put effort, the Lord too will reach his hand to guide us. Infact, knowing about Atma is difficult, because it's not seen, heard etc. Atleast dieties in temples, we can see and relish and celebrate fesivals etc, whereas for our atma this is not possible. So, this is difficult. Among innumerable beings, someone, who by great austerity has got rid of paap and has increased his merits, realises this self possessing the above mentioned nature, which is wonderful and distinct in kind from all things other than Itself. Such a one speaks of It to another. Thus, someone hears of It. And even after hearing of It, no one knows It exactly that It really exists. The term 'ca' implies that even amongst the seers, the speakers and hearers, one with authentic percepetion, authentic speech and authentic hearing, is a rarity."
633,स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य न विकम्पितुमर्हसि । धर्म्याद्धि युद्धाच्छ्रेयोऽन्यत्क्षत्रियस्य न विद्यते ॥ ॥,"Atma ; Nityam->Eternal; ""Na Tvam sochitu arhasi"".. THis is a common refrain of Krishna in many slokas, which implies that ""you do not grieve""! Here Krishna says that Self exists in everyone's body and even when all this bodies perish, the atma in them do not perish. Note that, Krishna says there is Jeevatma in everyone's body and it's not that ONE atma pervades all bodies! This is in response to Arjuna's doubt: 'I am understanding about the perishability of body as per krishan's slokas below. Now, everybody in this world seems different. One person varies from another in appearance, personality, esteem, joys and sorrows etc. So, is there a difference in the Jeevatmas nature too among people? i.e is one jeevatma's nature different from another?? Is one jeevatma eternal and the other not? "". In response, Krishna tells this sloka that the atmas residing in all bodies are eternal and do not perish, when the body perishes. Now, another question arises, when the bodies are different , how come the atma is same?? To remove this doubt only Sri Krishna tells that the atman or dehi in every body or deham is eternal. We are witnessing changes on the body but the soul remains the same. To understand this we should examine closely our daily habits and experiences. We see variety of persons. Some are fair, some black, some tall, some short, some females, some males, some animals, etc. but all these differences do not change our habits. One may be a millionaire and another a poor. But both see with their eyes only and hear with their ears. There is no difference in these functions. Educated or illiterate, one has to eat with his mouth only. So, God has not permitted any difference in certain basic functions. We eat varieties of food and vegetables. They remain so till what we eat reaches the throat. After this the body assimilates them as protein, vitamin or carbohydrates. This is scientific fact. We do not eat as such fat or proteins. So, all differences are in the external appearance only, such as brinjal or lady s finger . The body, however, takes only the essence. So, only those, which appear different, are all destroyed and atman, which is identical in every creature, is eternal. So Arjuna need not to worry that he may be destroying a destroyable atman. So, in this sloka Krishna says, that Arjuna need not show grief. . If we distinguish atman from body, then we can be of real help to not merely our relatives but to everyone suffering. Relatives are body related. Only a perspective that all atmans are same can make us render help to all. That is why in any calamity, there are some persons who concentrate on the things to do and do not go emotional. Such duty minded persons are of real help. Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.""Considering your specific duty as a kshatriya, you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is no need for hesitation."" In the previous slokas Krishna adviced that Arjuna should not show love and undue attention to the body, since it is temporary. In this slokam, he focusses on the importance of doing one's dharma. As a Kshatriya, it is Arjuna's duty to fight. There is no other way for Moksham for a Kshatriya. Now, there is a seeming ""controversy"" here. Here, Krishna says to Arjuna that he has to fight the war, if he wants to gain Moksham. In some quarters, Gita is incorrectly potrayed as a ""war goading"" book, which resulted in Mahabharat war. The question is, is ""fighting war"" the only way for Arjuna to gain moksham?? Not exactly. Krishna is telling Arjuna to do his Dharma. And Kshatriya's duty is to fight a ""righteous"" war and not run away. Had Krishna given Gita to a non-kshatriya, it would have been a different dharma . Another question, doesn't war involve killing and pain to other beings?? So, how would it be construed as a path to Moksham?? The reality is, there are different kinds of ""Himsa"" in this world . Himsa is something which gives pain not just for the present but also in the future. So, in this war, all the warriors who are fighting get ""veera"" swargam. As long as Arjuna is fighting a war justly and also a just war then it's his dharma and is assured of Moksham. Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the matter of good administration, is called ksatriya. Ksat means hurt. One who gives protection from harm is called ksatriya . There are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one's sva-dharma--specific duty--becomes adhyatmik and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the brahmanas and ksatriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. Sva-dharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane sva-dharma is called varnasrama-dharma, or man's steppingstone for adhyatmik understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of varnasrama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one's specific duty in any field of action in accordance with varnasrama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher status of life."

The impending war is happening by itself, on its own, without any solicitation on the part of Arjuna. Thus when it happens he and his brothers will be fighting on the side of righteousness which constitutes the means for acquiring heavenly happiness without obstacles. Such a war can only be fought by the most fortunate of ksatriyas and Arjuna should understand his good fortune. Krishna continues mentioning about the importance of Dharma here. He says Arjuna is facing this war, not out of his own making, but by ""yaddrachaya"" , which is a gateway to heaven, which is a blessing for the great and righteous Kshatriyas. Now that question arises, which ""swargam"" is Krishna referring to here? Is it Indra lokam etc?? No. Krishna is referring to Moksham here. **This also point out to how to qualify a decision - Before we engage ourselves in any work we will have to see these points: Is this legally allowed? After starting the work, will there be need for any unlawful activities? Is the objective a virtuous one or evil? Is there precedence by elders? These four points are required to be examined before we embark on any activity. In the present context, the fighting of this war has to answer all these quest ** Referring to Dharma Yuddham - The Lord himself went to war against tyrannical demons to protect Dharma. For e.g. Rama, Nrusimha, Vamana etc. In the Parasara-smrti or religious codes made by Parasara, the great sage and father of Vyasadeva, it is stated: ksatriyo hi praja raksan sastra-panih pradandayan nirjitya para-sainyadi ksitim dharmena palayet ""The ksatriya's duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world."" Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the svarga loka whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case."

In the previous two slokas, Krishna explained to Arjuna that it is imperative for him to follow his dharma as Kshatriya and fight the war which has come upon him as ""yaddhrachaya"" and that by doing so, he will achieve Moksham. In this sloka and the next, Krishna says the paap that will befall Arjuna if he does NOT fight the war. By listing the difficulties and sorrows he would encounter if he slipped from his expected duty, Sri Krishna is encouraging him to fight. In any act we have to state the benefits by doing that and the ill effects by not doing. By judging both one
has to conclude to perform an action. Krishna terms this war as ""Sangraamam"" and not ""Yuddham"", in this slokam. Why? Because the war has already started and the armies ready to battle! Yudhdham means it could start even next day or after. But sangramam means that is already started and when both sides are aligned and ready to fight. Peace efforts could have been initiated before start of a fight but not after it had started. Such efforts before the fight began would be appreciated; but after it had started any such efforts would be branded as act of cowardice. So Sri Krishna cautions that if Arjuna decided to withdraw from the war, he will be defamed and then he would also be slipping from his expected dharma, resulting in paapa to accumulate. So by abandoning the fight he will fail in his swadharmam, that is his duty as Kshatriya to fight, and lose kirti or fame. Even if he does not care for the fame, paap or paap will accrue for slipping from swadharma. Sri Krishna lists the two, swadharma and kirti, as necessities for life in this world and in the nether world. Sri Krishna uses the words dharmyam sangraman, which means fight performed righteously. This war is for establishing dharma, it is to be performed legally and the outcome also is for dharma, a high objective. Since Arjuna, desirous of preservation of dharma, this is a holy and upright war. The word sangramam is used instead of yudhdham. . Why? Because it is as per the law, dharma shastras, the results are worth it. If he doesn't fight this battle - all the fame he achieved in the past as a warrior will be gone, giving up his ""svadharma"" as a Kshatriya, he will incur Paapa . If through injudicious sentiment or bewildered ignorance Arjuna should fail to perform his prescribed duty as a ksatriya by fighting for the sake of righteousness; he would lose a most excellent opportunity of attaining the heavenly spheres, he would lose his reputation as a hero and he would have to accept great impure reaction.Losing Fame and Name is a big loss in this Lokam for a Kshatriya and Arjuna will lose it, if he doesn't battle. Not only that, even in the other worlds, Arjuna will be at loss, since by shirking his duty , he incurs paap and doesn't gain swargam. Karma Yogam basically is doing one's duty as per his ""ashrama dharma"" and that leads to Bhakti Yogam. If Arjuna is shedding his basic duty, he is not doing either Karma or Bhakti yogam and that leads him to paap. **Abide by swadharma is what is advocated."

In this slokam, Krishna continues detailing the ills which would befall if Arjuna runs away from the war. He says that Arjuna will lose his honor and reputation as great warrior which he gained from all times and be ridiculed by all people that he has run away from the battle. This infamy will be worse than death for somebody as honored and reputable as Arjuna. For a wise man, discrimination, courage, bravery, calmness and caution all need to be prevalent. Arjuna cannot say that he doesn't care about his reputation and run away. It may be ok for a common man, but for a great personality like Arjuna with a legacy of honor, it will come off poorly. Not only will happiness and fame elude him if he disregards his duty as a ksatriya but the world opinion of those competent to judge and those incompetent as well will chastise him and speak of his act of disgrace public and privately. They will say Arjuna was a coward for when the battle was about to begin he gave only excuses and retreated hastily from the battlefield. The Supreme Lord Krishna is telling him that forever history will brand him for cowardice. If Arjuna was to reply that what the public think is of no consequence to him, the Supreme Lord neutralises that by stating that for a person of honour possessing the qualities of heroism, determination, puissance, courage etc. which are all contrary to cowardice to have to accept infamy is worse than death. If he was to acquire disgrace of this kind death for him would certainly be much better. If reasoning further one was to present the question of how ignominy could attach itself to one who is already a renowned hero and whose resignation from the battle field is prompted only by motives of respect for elders and compassion to friends and relatives then the next verse 34 neutralises that argument."

""Astaana Sneham"" - Showing compassion to the wrong places and towards the wrong people, like Arjuna is doing by showing compassion etc towards Duryodhana etc. In this slokam, Krishna responds to Arjuna's doubt from the previous slokam. Arjuna asks how can he get dishonor when he is withdrawing from the battle only out of love and compassion towards his relatives and avoiding bloodshed. Krishna responds about Arjuna, the mahaarathis etc will think that out of fear that you ran from the battle and for those who have been thinking greatly of you, will think in the futurue lightly of you and treat you with contempt. Despite going through many humilations in losing the kingdom through treachery etc, Arjuna and other pandavas didn't lose their honor or reputation as great warriors among the common people, because they behaved with honor! Now, running away from the battle, would make him lose all the reputation. There is a thin dividing line between ""patience and compassion"" and ""cowardly and weak"". If somebody is very patient and tolerant, it can be sometimes miscontrued as weakness and cowardliness. In this case, it's possible that great understanding souls like Bheeshma and Drona would understand Arjuna's dilemma, but ""Duryodhana and Karna etc"" would not think it that way. Now, Arjuna says, he doesn't care about what Duryodhan etc thinks and would prefer to not battle. Krishna says, it's not just about Duryodhana, but even the common man will perceive Arjuna as running away from battle and not doing his duty. We should thus understand to differentiate between mercy and patience on one hand and incompetence and cowardice on the other."

What could be more painful for you? This slokam is also advising Arjuna not to show ""Astaana Sneham"". His enemies will talk a lot of unkind and fabricated words. His abilities will be vilified . For Arjuna who is so proud about his prowess and ""Gandhivaam"" would not be able to suffer this ignominy of being humilated by his enemies with slanderous remarks. That is what Krishna is warning Arjuna against. When a friend or wellwishers pass remarks like it, we can tolerate it, because they are close ones. But, when a enemy is vilifiying, a warrior like Arjuna cannot bear it. Now, Arjuna may think, Ok, so what if my enemies poke fun at me. Krishna also gives a vieled warning here, saying that Arjuna may then get provoked and fight the war and if he does so, then he will be potrayed as someone who is fighting due to being slighted and not for the people. A question may arise: Krishna himself ""ran away"" from battle with Jarasandha and went and built Dwarka city. Arjuna may have the question on why he is suggesting Arjuna to fight and not quit. Sri Krishna was born in Gokulam and after ten years, He lived in Mathura for some years. But King Jarasanda invaded Mathura several times. Seventeen times he invaded and Sri Krishna defeated him every time. Sri Krishna requested His brother Sri Balarama, to go to west seashore and reclaim land from the sea and establish a new city of Dwaraka. Sri Balarama did not agree. When next time Jarasanda invaded Mathura, Sri Krishna ran away from Mathura. Arjuna remembered this incident. But there are two main differences in the two incidents. Firstly, rules, which we follow, cannot be applied on the Lord. Secondly, Sri Krishna had vanquished Jarasanda several times and He was merely acting as though He was running away from Jarasanda out of fear. Here, for Arjuna this is the first time to fight with these people. So, how can he run away and compare this with Sri Krishna s action?"

640,सुखदुःखे समे कृत्वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ । ततो युद्धाय युज्यस्व नैवं पापमवाप्स्यसि ॥ ॥,"O son of Kunti, either you will be killed on the battlefield and attain the svarga loka, or you will conquer and enjoy the earthly kingdom. Therefore get up and fight with determination."" ""Tasmad Uttishtha Kaunteya"" - Thus! exhorts Krishna to Arjuna to Stand up with determination to fight , in this slokam. If you get killed, you will achieve Swargam and if you win, you will enjoy this worldly kingdom . If you don't fight, you will not achieve either glory here nor in other worlds. He addresses Arjuna as ""Kunti Putra"" , because Kunti is renowed for her courage and devotion. In addition, Kunti is Krishna's dear aunty and as such it becomes Krishna's responsibility to protect Krishna. Related comments: Some may say that Asoka gave up war and violence, whereas Krishna is prompting Arjuna for war. Asoka actually gave up wars etc, after fighting numerous wars. Whereas Arjuna's Dharma here is to wage war against Kauravas to protect his people and ensure the kingdom is not ruled by crooked Kauravas. In addition, when both opposition factions are in agreement to call of war, it may make sense to back off , but in this case, there is no such signal from Kauravas. Another question is, Arjuna didn't have similar qualms when warring with Kauravas in the past , but why is he having the fear now?? In the past, he didn't have to worry about killing Drona or Bheeshma or other close relatives, so there was no issue."
641,एषा तेऽभिहिता सांख्ये बुद्धिर्योगे त्विमां शृणु । बुद्ध्या युक्तो यया पार्थ कर्मबन्धं प्रहास्यसि ॥ ॥,"This begins the prelude to KARMA YOGAM section. Krishna says Arjuna will not incur sun , if he just engages in war just for the sake of war and not with sense of attachment or results. What attachment or results is Krishna referring to here - be equanimous in joy and sorrow i.e no need to feel joy by killing enemies or felling them or no need to feel sorrow in felling opponents such as Bhishma etc. We cannot equate Joy and Sorrow as one, but the feelings and reactions which emanate in the face of joy and sorrow - those feelings is something we need to control and look at it with some sense of detachment. The same sense of equanimity should also be there in the face of gain and loss, victory and defeat. This is in response to Arjuna's lament that he doesn't care about kingdom, winning etc and doesn't want to fight. In response, Krishna said that Arjuna should fight , since it's his duty, which will result in his gaining heavenly kingdom . In this slokam, Krishna says that Arjuna should fight as a sense of duty and not get disturbed by dualities such as joy & sorrow, victory & defeat, gain&loss. This is a important qualification for a KarmaYogi! Krishna says that Arjuna should fight as a Karma yogi, as a sense of duty, without consideration or attachment or disturbed by gain or loss, victory or defeat etc and when he does it, there will be no incurring of paap. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to reaction, good or bad. Knowing the immortal eternal soul to be that which is distinct and independent from the physical body, uncontaminated with the qualities pertaining to the material existence but connected to those qualities which are adhyatmik in nature and eternal; maintaining an equipoised mind in the various conditions of pleasure and pain, loss and gain, victory or defeat being devoid of any fruitive desire or hankering for any reward or remuneration, such as going to the heavenly worlds, fight this righteous battle as a matter of duty which needs to be discharged. One who is situated in wisdom with their mind properly composed in this manner while executing their prescribed duties will incur no impure reactions and thus will be eligible for salvation from material existence. Immoral reactions is the root of all suffering and the cause of perpetual bondage in the cycle of birth and death in the material existence. Arjuna is baffled on how he can do it. Krishna points out that as Rama in the previous avtaar, he followed this same principles!!""Thus far I have described atman to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without trivial results. O son of Pritha, when you act with such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of karma."" This sloka starts the KARMA yogam section, where krishna expounds on Karma yoga. Gita is the extraction of the sayings of Upanishad. Upanishad - UPA, Nishana . Upanishad tells us the reality of Brahman and the ways to reach close to Brahman. The ways it propounds is Karma Yogam, Jnaana Yogam, Bhakti Yogam. In this it's generally considered that Bhakti Yogam is primary and Karma and Jnaana Yogam are it's ancillary i.e for Bhakti, one needs Karma and Jnaana anushtaanam as pre-requisites. nstead of practicing each separately, it is better to have one as the pradhanam and the other two as angam . Just like in our degree courses we have one subject, say Chemistry, as main and study say, mathematics and physics, as ancillaries. Similarly, if one decides to seek Moksham through Karmayoga, then one has to have Gyanayoga and Bhakthiyoga as ancillaries. But there is a difference. In the education system, pass in the main can be done without studying the ancillaries. Whereas, in seeking Moksham, if Bhakthiyoga has to be practiced, then one has to practice Karmayoga and Gyanayoga. Without these two, a person cannot practice Bhakthiyoga. Upanishad says - Atma Drashtavaya, Stortavyaa, mantvyaya, nidhistavyaaya - i.e we should constantly, deeply, exclusively hear about the lord for reaching him. Question is, we also need to know how to conduct ourselves in this world, while we seek to achieve salvation. The primary requirement for it is to realise that body is temporary and soul is eternal and salvation lies in getting out of the cycle of birth and death. If one doesn't realise this, then it's not possible to get away from this never ending cycle and we will be forever caught in this web of material existence. So, the first step is to realise that Soul is eternal and body is temporary. To realize Paramatma, atman has to listen about Him. Then, contemplate on what was listened to. Then meditate without interruption , but with concentration. Such continuous meditation is called Bhakthi and this results in merging with the Paramatma. This will make the atman to feel happy in union with and sorrow in separation from God. Thereafter, the soul departs this body and this world and reaches Moksham and remains with Him in eternal happiness. It is a stairway to Moksham. All born cannot immediately go for Moksham. In this world lots of good things are to be done and this life has to be happily spent. But the objective should be to reach Moksham after this life without the perils of another birth. When will this thought come? First, one should realize that this body is perishable and atman is indestructible. If one thinks atman and body are same, when body perishes, atman also will perish and then there would be no need for Moksham or worry about rebirth. So, this basic knowledge that atman and body are different is essential. Not merely accepting that they are separate, it should be firmly believed that atman is eternal and body is destroyable. Further, it should be realized that in this life happiness and sorrow are mixed. The natural feeling of the atman is always happy. But when inside a body in this earth, mixed feelings are unavoidable. So, the objective should be to get the everlasting happiness, its natural quality. This pursuit is necessary. Next step is to know that Soul is owned by Paramatma and we are not owners or independent. This realization about atman and body is the first step in the stairway. This step alone cannot take to the top. The next step is to realize that this atman is servant of God. Paramatma is the ruler and atman is ruled. Therefore, atman has to cling to the Feet of the Lord. Instead of saying that Karmayaoga, Gyanayoga and Bhakthyoga are various paths to reach Moksham, Bhakthyoga is the main. Visiting temples, chanting His names and helping His devotees, will all constitute Bhakthiyoga. For this as main one needs Karma and Gyana . These are needed in any activity. Ways to reach the lord are Karma, Jnaana and Bhakti Yogam. Rather than saying three yogams are seperate and independent, we can say Bhakti yogam is the primary way to reach lord and this involves singing, chanting, visting holy places, helping others, being close to devotees etc. Bhakti yogam has two angas, karma and Jnaana - it requires discipline and knowledge. It is similar to - for riding a vehicle, one needs knowledge that vehicle requires petrol etc to run, need to operate clutch and brake together, brake to stop the vehicle and in addition one needs the skills to operate the vehicle. Similarly for Bhakti, one needs knowledge and discipline. ANd to even start this course, the primary pre-requisite is the basic knowledge that Atma is Nityam and Body is temporary. Krishna has followed the same pattern. From slokas 2-12 onwards to sloka 2-30, Krishna has emphasized that Atma is Nityam and temporary nature of the body. From Slokams 2-39 to 2-51, Krishna expounds on Karma Yogam and after that he expounds Jnaana Yogam and in Chapters 7,8,9 he expounds on Bhakti Yogam and in the later chapters he explains the ways for Moksha. So, Geeta has been laid out in this manner - Initially in the second chapter , it tells us the nature of the soul and the temporary nature of body, since this is the primary pre-requisite. Next, it explains the ways of Karma Yogam i.e how to do our duties. NExt, it explains Jnaana yogam . Next, it explains Bhakti yogam and next it explains ways for Moksham. In this slokam, ""esa te abhihitA SANKHYE!"" - note, esA te i.e in the slokas , i have explained the philosophy of Sankhye!. Sankhya means ""buddhi"" and Sankhyam is ""the Atma which is understood by Buddhi"" and Sankhye is the philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul . I.e i have explained about Sankya Yoga. 'Sankhya' means 'intellect,' and the truth about the Atman, which is determinable by the intellect, is 'Sankhyam'. Concerning the nature of the self which has to be known, whatever Buddhi has to be taught, has been taught to you in the passage beginning with, 'It is not that I did not exist' and ending with the words, 'Therefore, you shall not grieve for any being' . Krishna says - ""yayA buddhyA yuktah"" - that buddhih by which , ""Karma bandham prahAsyasi"" you can released from bondage of reaction - that knowledge will be explained to him. The disposition of mind which is required for the performance of works preceded by knowledge of the self and which thus constitutes the means of attaining release, that is here called by the term Yoga. It will be clearly told later on, 'Work done with desire for fruits is far inferior to work done with evennes of mind' . ""buddhir yoge tv imAm srunu"" - Now Listen about yogE buddhi . What Buddhi or attitude of mind is required for making your act deserve the name of Yoga, listen to it now. Endowed with that knowledge, you will be able to cast away the bondage of Karma. 'Karma-bandha' means the bondage due to Karma i.e., the bondage of Samsara. 'Sankhya' means 'intellect,' and the truth about the Atman, which is determinable by the intellect, is 'Sankhyam'. Concerning the nature of the self which has to be known, whatever Buddhi has to be taught, has been taught to you in the passage beginning with, 'It is not that I did not exist' and ending with the words, 'Therefore, you shall not grieve for any being' . The disposition of mind which is required for the performance of works preceded by knowledge of the self and which thus constitutes the means of attaining release, that is here called by the term Yoga. It will be clearly told later on, 'Work done with desire for fruits is far inferior to work done with evennes of mind' . What Buddhi or attitude of mind is required for making your act deserve the name of Yoga, listen to it now. Endowed with that knowledge, you will be able to cast away the bondage of Karma. 'Karma-bandha' means the bondage due to Karma i.e., the bondage of Samsara. Now question comes up, Arjuna is not intrested in fighting. So, why is Krishna talking about Sankha Yogam, Karma yogam etc, rather than just exhorting Arjuna to fight?? Krishna first explains thru Sankha Yogam that Souls are eternal and body is temporary, thus killing in a just war is not sinful and Arjuna shouldn't go weak at the thought of killing relatives etc. Next, Krishna addresses the concern of Arjuna about not being intrested in fruits of war etc, by talking about Karma Yogam and explaining that Arjuna need not fight for fruitive results, but a Saadhanam for Moksham. Waging just war is a Kshatriya Dharma and is his karma yogam. Karma Yogam: Introduction: One can do a thing anywhere, or as prescribed in vedas or not prescribed according to vedas. But, if one performs a duty in a ""loukeeka"" fashion, one doesn't get any benefit other than material benefits. But, if one does one's duty as per the viddhi of vedas, eg> when we bath at home, under a tap etc, there is no additional benefit, apart from cleaning body. But, if we take a dip in ganges and other temple pushkarinis, the body not only gets cleaned, but we are also blessed with washing away of paap. Why? Because it's prescribed in vedas. What constitutes Karma yogam - All our daily activities, eating, sleeping, working, helping etc basically constitute Karma yogam. Simple? Right? Yes. But, this needs to be done as per the prescription of Vedas and not do anything which is NOT prescribed in the vedas. And it needs to be done in full faith and spirit and also NOT with sense of attachment. For eg: if one takes bath in Pushkarini, without any belief in it's powers, then it will not help. Again, What is Karma yoga? It is eating, sleeping, working, etc. Nothing extra is required to be done. But these activities are to be done as prescribed in shastras. This is very important. If we do our activities according to the dos and don ts of shastras, it is karmayoga. If we do karma yoga we are sure to attain Moksham. Shastras are instructions given by God. He has told that He liberates the one who faithfully follows His instructions. Once we have that belief that we are acting according to the stipulations of the Lord, He also will erase all our paap and make us to reach our natural state of happiness,Moksham. In these instructions one is asked to eat, sleep and work. Nowhere the shastras ask us not to do anything else. The person instructed could be a bachelor or married or sanyasin or a beast or bird. Whoever be, if the prescribed action is performed with a firm belief that this will yield Moksham, that result will be achieved. A bath in this pond with a belief that it will only remove my body dirt, then this action will not get Moksham. But same action with a firm belief that I will get Moksham, by bathing in this pond, will get Moksham. So a steadfast belief is to be there along with the vidhi. So: Karma Yogam constitutes: * Performing duties which are prescribed and NOT doing anything which is against prescribed * Belief in it and doing it as Bhagavan's viddhi that it's a means for moksham. . Karma can be divided into three: * Nitya Karma - to be practiced daily. Tharpanam, Daana-Dharama, Festival celebration * Naimitika Karma - to be performed due to certain reasons or in certain occasions * Kaamya Karma - Doing things with desire for material benefits, to achieve certain goals eg: passing exam, marriage etc All these karmas or actions are stipulated. These have to be done uninterruptedly. Performing annual ceremonies for deceased forefathers , celebrating festivals, etc. are all Karma yoga. Why Sri Krishna is encouraging Arjuna to fight? Because it is stipulated for him. He is asked to do what he learnt. So, Karma yoga can be performed by anybody. Sri Krishna lauds the greatness of Karma yoga in the next sloka."
642,नेहाभिक्रमनाशोऽस्ति प्रत्यवायो न विद्यते । स्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् ॥ ॥,"2-38: Sukha-dukhe samEy krtva, lAbhaAlabhau jayaAjayau, tathO yudhAya yujasva, naivam pApam avApsyAsi. This begins the prelude to KARMA YOGAM section. Krishna says Arjuna will not incur sun , if he just engages in war just for the sake of war and not with sense of attachment or results. What attachment or results is Krishna referring to here - be equanimous in joy and sorrow i.e no need to feel joy by killing enemies or felling them or no need to feel sorrow in felling opponents such as Bhishma etc. We cannot equate Joy and Sorrow as one, but the feelings and reactions which emanate in the face of joy and sorrow - those feelings is something we need to control and look at it with some sense of detachment. The same sense of equanimity should also be there in the face of gain and loss, victory and defeat. This is in response to Arjuna's lament that he doesn't care about kingdom, winning etc and doesn't want to fight. In response, Krishna said that Arjuna should fight , since it's his duty, which will result in his gaining heavenly kingdom . In this slokam, Krishna says that Arjuna should fight as a sense of duty and not get disturbed by dualities such as joy & sorrow, victory & defeat, gain&loss. This is a important qualification for a KarmaYogi! Krishna says that Arjuna should fight as a Karma yogi, as a sense of duty, without consideration or attachment or disturbed by gain or loss, victory or defeat etc and when he does it, there will be no incurring of paap. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to reaction, good or bad. Knowing the immortal eternal soul to be that which is distinct and independent from the physical body, uncontaminated with the qualities pertaining to the material existence but connected to those qualities which are adhyatmik in nature and eternal; maintaining an equipoised mind in the various conditions of pleasure and pain, loss and gain, victory or defeat being devoid of any fruitive desire or hankering for any reward or remuneration, such as going to the heavenly worlds, fight this righteous battle as a matter of duty which needs to be discharged. One who is situated in wisdom with their mind properly composed in this manner while executing their prescribed duties will incur no impure reactions and thus will be eligible for salvation from material existence. Immoral reactions is the root of all suffering and the cause of perpetual bondage in the cycle of birth and death in the material existence. Arjuna is baffled on how he can do it. Krishna points out that as Rama in the previous avtaar, he followed this same principles!!""Thus far I have described atman to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without trivial results. O son of Pritha, when you act with such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of karma."" This sloka starts the KARMA yogam section, where krishna expounds on Karma yoga. Gita is the extraction of the sayings of Upanishad. Upanishad - UPA, Nishana . Upanishad tells us the reality of Brahman and the ways to reach close to Brahman. The ways it propounds is Karma Yogam, Jnaana Yogam, Bhakti Yogam. In this it's generally considered that Bhakti Yogam is primary and Karma and Jnaana Yogam are it's ancillary i.e for Bhakti, one needs Karma and Jnaana anushtaanam as pre-requisites. nstead of practicing each separately, it is better to have one as the pradhanam and the other two as angam . Just like in our degree courses we have one subject, say Chemistry, as main and study say, mathematics and physics, as ancillaries. Similarly, if one decides to seek Moksham through Karmayoga, then one has to have Gyanayoga and Bhakthiyoga as ancillaries. But there is a difference. In the education system, pass in the main can be done without studying the ancillaries. Whereas, in seeking Moksham, if Bhakthiyoga has to be practiced, then one has to practice Karmayoga and Gyanayoga. Without these two, a person cannot practice Bhakthiyoga.

643,व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन । बहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् ॥ ॥,"2-40: nehA-abhikrama nAso-asti! Pratya-vAyo na vidyate! svalpam apya-sya dharmasya! trAyateh mahato bhayAt! ""In this endeavor there is no loss or lessening for a little advancement on this path and can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear."" In this slokam, Krishna expounds the benefit and greatness of Karma Yogam. Just like a Parent tells a kid that what glory would be, if he achieves 99% marks , to intrest the kid in studying, similarly Krishna tells the greatness of Karma Yogam to Arjuna, before explaining the details of Karma Yogam. ""NehA abikramoa-Nasao Asti"" - There is no loss in this Karma yogam. eg. unlike leaves which ""lapse"", this doesn't lapse. It ""carries"" over it's benefits. For eg: if we follow for sometime and discontinue, the benefits of whatever we did will not lapse. One percent of work done in Krishna consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material business, without a hundred percent profit there is no success. or it's like writing an exam- attempt an answer but even if you do not get the right answer or not complete it, even then the examiner puts marks based on how much you wrote correctly. ""pratyavAyo na vidyate"" - Another fear is, if we stop karma in between, we incur paap etc. Arjuna is scared that incuring paap would make it a bigger issue and invite additional paap. Krishna says here that, there is no need to fear and it does not happen that way, as long as one performs duties with selfless spirit as a sense of duty for Moksham and not for material gains etc. ""Svalpma apsya Dharmasya"" - Even performing a little will still help. Atleast do svalpa! ""TrAyateh Mahatoh BhayAt"" - Doing the above can protect one from the greatest danger and fear of samsara. The Supreme Lord Krishna reveals that even the slightest, most minuscule effort made regarding this karma yoga of performing actions without desiring fruitive results is never in vain. The word abhikrama is derived from arambha meaning any beginning as in any effort. The word nasa means destruction as in loss of, thus the effort itself is the means to a guaranteed result. Not even is failure accrued when a righteous action is begun but is unable to be completed due to circumstances and absolutely no negative effect will accrue even when a righteous action is interrupted at its very commencement. Even a the most minute righteous action performed without desiring fruitive results saves one with adhyatmik knowledge from the great fear of the endless cycle of birth and death in the material existence. This same view is further elaborated later in chapter six, verse 40 describing that in this world or the next there is no loss or dimunition for the aspirant.""Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose,"

Similar to the version as given in Varahapurana, there are descriptions Yamapuri including the mansions, rivers and streams of milk and ghee for the enjoyment of righteous persons who have made the gifts of cows."

Chitraketu and his wife Kritadyuti were childless. Seeing their sorrow Angirasa maharshi informs them that a son would be born to them. However, the envy of Chitraketu's other wives led them to poison the child and kill him at birth. Angirasa and Narada tried to revive the child but the soul replies that he was the son to a large number of parents, in various births, and requested to be enlightened as to which of those parents he was to live with. Understanding the situation, Narada leaves after imparting adhyatmik wisdom to Chitraketu and his wife. Both of them then immerse themselves in the adhyatmik path and attain the form of Gandharvas. Once in the land of Vidyadharas, Chitraketu was travelling in the aerial space in the vehicle given by SriMahavishnu. When flying over the Mountain Kailasa, the abode of Shiva and Parvati, Chitraketu laughs at the sight of Parvati being seated in the lap of Shiva. He accuses Shiva, being enlightened is embracing his consort, Parvati, when present in the view of Siddhas and saintly people as an ordinary human being.

May our study of the vedas and our progeny increase! May we never forsake the vaidika activity! May we have enough riches to provide to our successors!' ."
724,एवं निर्वपणं कृत्वा पिण्डांस्तांस्तदनन्तरम् । गां विप्रमजमग्निं वा प्राशयेदप्सु वा क्षिपेत् पिण्डनिर्वपणं के चित्परस्तादेव कुर्वते । वयोभिः खादयन्त्यन्ये प्रक्षिपन्त्यनलेऽप्सु वा,"Having thus completed the shraddha offering, one should offer the pindas to a cow, a brahmana or a goat, or offer it to the sacred fire or water. Some make the offering of the pindas before the brahmana bhojana; some offer it for birds to eat or some leave it into fire or water ."
725,पतिव्रता धर्मपत्नी पितृपूजनतत्परा । मध्यमं तु ततः पिण्डमद्यात्सम्यक्सुतार्थिनी आयुष्मन्तं सुतं सूते यशोमेधासमन्वितम् । धनवन्तं प्रजावन्तं सात्त्विकं धार्मिकं तथा प्रक्षाल्य हस्तावाचाम्य ज्ञातिप्रायं प्रकल्पयेत् । ज्ञातिभ्यः सत्कृतं दत्त्वा बान्धवानपि भोजयेत्,"A faithful wife, who is desirous of bearing a son, may eat the middle pinda kept in the honour of the grandfather. By this, she will bring forth a son long-lived, successful, intelligent, wealthy, blessed with progeny and endowed with the qualities of truthfulness and righteousness. Then, having washed hands, one should serve food to one's own relations and then to others ."
726,उच्छेषणं तु तत्तिष्ठेद्यावद्विप्रा विसर्जिताः । ततो गृहबलिं कुर्यादिति धर्मो व्यवस्थितः,"After the brahmanas leave, having cleared the remnants from that place; one should perform the offerings of vaishvadeva and bhuta bali. This is the regulated procedure ."
727,प्राचीनावीतिना सम्यगपसव्यमतन्द्रिणा । पित्र्यम् आ निधनात्कार्यं विधिवद्दर्भपाणिना,"It is said that, one should duly perform shraddha , untired, holding the kusha grass in the hands, unto death ."

Because expanding the scale of yajna destroys five things - appropriate treatment of the invited, place, time, purity and presence of the most virtuous brahmana as guests; one should not, therefore, seek to entertain a large company ."
729,एकमप्याशयेद्विप्रं पित्रर्थे पाञ्चयज्ञिके ॥ ॥,"Therefore, one must feed atleast one brahmana in honour of the forefathers at the shraddha, which is a part of the five great yajnas ."

Because, as long as the food remains warm, the brahmanas eat in silence and the qualities of the food are not proclaimed, only until then the forefathers partake of the food. While, the fruit of what a brahmana eats by tying a cloth around the head, facing the south and wearing his sandals goes to the rakshasas ."
731,ज्ञानोत्कृष्टाय देयानि कव्यानि च हवींषि च ॥ ॥ सहस्रं हि सहस्राणामनृचां यत्र भुञ्जते । एकस्तान्मन्त्रवित्प्रीतः सर्वानर्हति धर्मतः ॥ ॥ यत्नेन भोजयेच्छ्राद्धे बह्वृचं वेदपारगम् । शाखान्तगमथाध्वर्युं छन्दोगं तु समाप्तिकम् ॥ ॥ एषामन्यतमो यस्य भुञ्जीत श्राद्धमर्चितः । पितॄणां तस्य तृप्तिः स्याच्छाश्वती साप्तपौरुषी ॥ ॥,"Food in honour of the deities and the forefathers must be given to a brahmana high in knowledge alone and not to a fool. Infact, it is said that, the fruit of ten lakh brahmanas, unacquainted with the vedas, dining at a funeral offering is obtained when a single brahmana learned in the veda is fed. Therefore, one is advised to feed well at a Shraddha, a Rigvedi brahmana , Yajurvedi brahmana or a Samavedi brahmana . Because, even if one of these three brahmanas obtains food and honour at a shraddha, the seven generations of ancestors of that yajamana are satisfied ."
732,मातामहं मातुलं च स्वस्रीयं श्वशुरं गुरुम् । दौहित्रं विट्पतिं बन्धुं ऋत्विग्याज्यौ च भोजयेत् ॥ ॥,"If none of the brahmanas mentioned above are available, then one may feed one's maternal grandfather, a maternal uncle, a sister's son, a father-in-law, one's teacher, a son-in-law, an aunt's son, Rtvik and the performer of the yajna ."

In oblations to the forefathers, the one focused on atmajnana is ought to be fed. While all four of them must dine in the offerings to the deities. Therefore, one is advised to have a brahmana from a lineage of knowers of the vedas. For, he is the medium of food offered to the deities or to the forefathers ."
734,न ब्राह्मणं परीक्षेत दैवे कर्मणि धर्मवित् । पित्र्ये कर्मणि तु प्राप्ते परीक्षेत प्रयत्नतः ॥ ॥ अश्रोत्रियः पिता यस्य पुत्रः स्याद्वेदपारगः । अश्रोत्रियो वा पुत्रः स्यात्पिता स्याद्वेदपारगः ॥ ॥ ज्यायांसमनयोर्विद्याद्यस्य स्याच्छ्रोत्रियः पिता । मन्त्रसंपूजनार्थं तु सत्कारम् इतरोऽर्हति ॥ ॥,"It is said that, for a rite sacred to the deities, one need not make detailed inquiries regarding an invited brahmana; however, in a ceremony in honour of the forefathers, one must carefully examine the invited guest. In case, the father is ignorant of the sacred texts but son has learnt vedas and similarly, when a son is ignorant of the vedas but the father is well versed in the same, know that, he whose father knows the veda, is venerable while the other is worthy of honour too ."
735,न श्राद्धे भोजयेन्मित्रं धनैः कार्योऽस्य संग्रहः । नारिं न मित्रं यं विद्यात्तं श्राद्धे भोजयेद्द्विजम् ॥ ॥ यस्य मित्रप्रधानानि श्राद्धानि च हवींषि च । तस्य प्रेत्य फलं नास्ति श्राद्धेषु च हविःषु च ॥ ॥ यः संगतानि कुरुते मोहाच्छ्राद्धेन मानवः । स स्वर्गाच्च्यवते लोकाच्छ्राद्धमित्रो द्विजाधमः ॥ ॥ संभोजानि साभिहिता पैशाची दक्षिणा द्विजैः । इहैवास्ते तु सा लोके गौरन्धेवैकवेश्मनि ॥ ॥,"One should not feed a friend at a funeral offering; one should feed a brahmana who is neither a foe nor a friend. For, the fruits of feeding only friends in funeral offerings and Yajnas , is not rewarded in the other world. In fact, the ignorant one who builds friendships through a funeral offering, doesn't obtain heaven. And the shraddha food offered to friends is called as 'Paishachi Dakshina' which like a alone blind cow staying in the same stable, remains in this world ."
736,एतान्विगर्हिताचारानपाङ्क्तेयान्द्विजाधमान् । द्विजातिप्रवरो विद्वानुभयत्र विवर्जयेत् ब्राह्मणो त्वनधीयानस्तृणाग्निरिव शाम्यति । तस्मै हव्यं न दातव्यं न हि भस्मनि हूयते,"According to Manusmrti, a knowledgeable brahmana should shun at yajnas to the deities and to the forefathers the above mentioned lowly brahmanas of spoilt conduct and those who are unworthy of sitting in the company of shraddha bhojana. Because, a brahmana who has not read the vedas is as lifeless as an extinguished fire of dry grass; And an offering is never made in ashes ."
737,अव्रतैर्यद्द्विजैर्भुक्तं परिवेत्रादिभिस्तथा । अपाङ्क्तेयैर्यदन्यैश्च तद्वै रक्षांसि भुञ्जते,"The food that is offered to Brahmanas who have not taken up the vow of studentship, a Parivetta and to other men not admissible into the company is termed as Rakshasa Bhojana ."

739,यत्तु वाणिजके दत्तं नेह नामुत्र तद्भवेत् ।,Whatever is given to a trader in a shraddha becomes fruitless in this world and the other .

Hence, it is said, feeding even one learned brahmana at the offering to the deities and forefathers yields great reward which cannot be obtained even by feeding many ignorant ones. Just as one reaps no harvest by sowing the seed in barren soil, similarly, the giver of food offering gains no reward if he presented it to an ignorant unacquainted with the Vedas. However, a present made in accordance with the rules to a learned man, makes the giver and the recipient partakers of rewards in both this world and the other. ."
742,कामं श्राद्धेऽर्चयेन्मित्रं नाभिरूपमपि त्वरिम् । द्विषता हि हविर्भुक्तं भवति प्रेत्य निष्फलम् ॥ ॥,"However, if no learned Brahmana is available, one may rather honour a friend than a learned enemy, for that bears no reward. ."

But never by Shvavrtti. Wherein, Rta refers to the gleaning of corn; Amrta is that which is obtained unasked; Mrta refers to begging and agriculture is called as Pramrta. Trading is considered Satyanrta and one may subsist even by that. However, one should avoid slavery as it is called Shvavrtti ."
745,वर्जयेत्तां सदा विप्रो राजन्यश्च जुगुप्सिताम् । सर्ववेदमयो विप्रः सर्वदेवमयो नृपः ॥ ॥,"The Bhagavata Purana further adds that, a brahmana and a kshatriya should always shun shvavrtti which is detested by all; for a brahmana is an embodiment of all the Vedas and Kshatriya is the personification of all deities."
746,वृत्तिः सङ्करजातीनां तत्तत्कुलकृता भवेत् । अचौराणामपापानामन्त्यजान्तेवसायिनाम् ॥ ॥,"While the means of livelihood of mixed castes such as the antyajas, antevasiyas are the hereditary callings followed by their respective families, provided it is not robbery and any vocation that is considered a papa."
747,वृत्त्या स्वभावकृतया वर्तमानः स्वकर्मकृत् । हित्वा स्वभावजं कर्म शनैर्निर्गुणतामियात् ॥ ॥,"Therefore, all the Varnas have been assigned specific Upajivikas for the smooth functioning of the society. And it is said that the one who follows a vocation determined as suitable to his special nature and does his duty, goes on relinquishing that type of work suitable to his disposition and gradually attains to the state of the attributeless atman."
748,जघन्यो नोत्तमां वृत्तिमनापदि भजेन्नरः । ऋते राजन्यमापत्सु सर्वेषामपि सर्वशः ॥ ॥,"Accordingly, no person born in a lower class should adopt the vocation ordained for the higher class, unless threatened with serious danger, says the Bhagavata Purana. However, Kshatriyas are mentioned as an exception to this rule. The Kshatriyas can adopt brahmanical means of livelihood, except that of accepting charitable gifts. At the same time, it also says that, in times of danger, anybody may resort to any profession ."

Among these four Brahmanas, each later one is considered more distinguished, and through the virtue of righteousness, he is said to have conquered the fruits of heaven. Out of these four types of Grhasthas, subsisting by one of the six means is prescribed for those with a large family. Those with a smaller family, are advised to subsist through performance ofYajnas, teaching Vedas and accepting charity. Those not willing to accept charity are expected to subsist with Yajana and Adhyapana . While the last one, should subsist by teaching the Vedas alone."
750,न भोजनार्थं स्वे विप्रः कुलगोत्रे निवेदयेत् । भोजनार्थं हि ते शंसन्वान्ताशीत्युच्यते बुधैः,"It is said that, a Brahmana should not name his family and gotra for the sake of food; if he does so, he is called a vantashi ."
751,अद्रोहेणैव भूतानां अल्पद्रोहेण वा पुनः । या वृत्तिस्तां समास्थाय विप्रो जीवेदनापदि यात्रामात्रप्रसिद्ध्यर्थं स्वैः कर्मभिरगर्हितैः । अक्लेशेन शरीरस्य कुर्वीत धनसंचयम्,", The Brahmana shall, in normal times, subsist by taking to that means of livelihood which involves no troubleor very little troubleto living beings. .At the same time, one should not do any bad deed for sustaining himself and his family. And one should accumulate wealth without unduly fatiguing one's body. (Manu Smrt. 4.3"

One should never, for the sake of subsistence, get carried away by the ways of the world or resort to false praise; rather one should adopt a pure, straightforward behaviour and by not taking up the work of a businessman, lead the honest life of a Brahmana. .He who wants happiness should adopt perfect contentment and remain self-controlled. Happiness has its root in contentment, and its opposite is the root of unhappiness. (Manu Smrt. 4.12"

It is said that, alms brought forward and offered, and not previously begged, Prajapati has declared to be acceptable, even from a person of bad deeds. .In fact, the forefathers do not accept theshraddhafor fifteen years andagnidoes not carry the havya given by those who disdain such a freely-offered donation."

However, when the Teachers are dead, or when one lives in his house without them,then, seeking for one's own subsistence, one may always accept gifts from good persons. (Manu Smrt. 4.251 and 252"

The superior knowledge that teaches about the transcendent entity knowing which leads to attainment of immortality.
759,तमादेशमप्राक्ष्यः येनाश्रुतं श्रुतं भवति अमतं मतं अविज्ञातं विज्ञातं इति,The 6th chapter of Chandogya Upanishad begins with a view to show that the Self in all is One. The dialogue between Svetaketu and Uddalaka is for the purpose of showing the gravity of the philosophy. After twelve years of Vedic studies Shvetaketu returns home thinking himself to be a brahma jnanin . But Uddalaka seeing his son's pride asked him:
760,यथा सोम्यैकेन मृत्पिण्डेन सर्वं मृन्मयं विज्ञातं स्यात्वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयं मृत्तिकेत्येव सत्यम्”,"Shvetaketu was unaware of such a type of knowledge, though he had studied the Vedas properly. So he desired to know what kind of instruction that was. The father explains thus:"
761,अन्नमयं हि मन आपोमयः प्राणः तेजोमयी वाक्,"Uddlaka rui demonstrates to his son vetaketu without annam the mind does not work properly. vetaketu was asked not to take food for fifteen days; he did so and then, he was unable to remember the Vedas he studied. Later he ate and was able to remember all. Uddlaka concludes by asserting that mind consists in annam, pra consists in water and speech consists in energy:"
762,स्वं अपीतो भवति तस्मात् एनम्स्व पितीत्याचक्षते,Uddlaka continues his teaching as in verse 6.8 by explaining what sleep means. In sleep one is fully possessed by SAT which is his origin:
763,स य एषोഽणिमा ऐतदात्म्यमिदम् सर्वं तत् सत्यम् स आत्मा तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो,"here or, in other words, on shedding this body, every being merges into tm, is a very important one. It scotches all talks about rebirth of the same individual. Personal identity is lost on merging with tm which is an incessant, all-pervading entity, without a second."
764,त इह व्याघ्रो वा सिंहो वा वृको वा वराहो वा कीटो वा पतङ्गो वा दंशो वा मशको वा यद्यद् भवन्ति तदाभवन्ति’,"This means that they exist as merged in the Supreme Entity without knowing their personal identity, as in the case of nectar of various trees in the honey. The verse is as follows:"
765,शृणु नामानि लोकानां मातॄणां शङ्कराणि च ।। अथ कश्यपपत्नीनां यत्प्रसूतमिदं जगत् । अदितिर्दितिर्दनुः काष्ठा अरिष्टा सुरसा इला ।। मुनिः क्रोधवशा ताम्रा सुरभिः सरमा तिमिः । तिमेर्यादोगणा आसन्श्वापदाः सरमासुताः,"In Srimad Bhagavata it is said that Sarama is the wife of Kashyapa rshi and is the mother of all animals including tigers and lions. Summary: ""O King Parikshit, now please hear from me the names of Kasyapa's wives, from whose wombs the population of the entire universe has come. They are the mothers of almost all the population of the entire universe and their names are very auspicious to hear. They are Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kashtha, Arishta, Surasa, Ila, Muni, Krodhavasha, Tamra, Surabhi, Sarama and Timi. From the womb of Timi, all the aquatics took birth and from the womb of Sarama, the ferocious animals like the tigers and lions took birth."""

767,प्रत्यक्षानुमानोपमानशब्दाः प्रमाणानि ।।,To facilitate ease of explaining the various pramanas the sutras of Nyaya darshana have been used to explain four of these six pramanas in the present article. It may be noted that while these same concepts are accepted in other darshanas also they are in some instances assumed and not explicitly mentioned as sutras. Gautama in his Nyayasutras lays down that there are four kinds of Pramanas.

The cause is 'purva' or prior to the effect; hence that in which the Anumana is based on the cognition of the cause has been called Purvavat."
771,अथवा पूर्ववदिति यत्र यथा पूर्व्वं प्रत्यक्षभूतयोः अन्यतरदर्शनेन अन्यतरस्य अप्रत्यक्षस्य अनुमानम् । यथा धूमेनाग्निरिति ।,"Purvavat Anumana is that in which the effect is inferred from the cause; e.g. when we see the clouds rising, we infer that there will be rain.

In Shanti Parva it is explained that the dharma of people varies from one age to another: tapasya is best in Sat Yuga, Gnana in Treta Yuga, and Yajna in Dwapar Yug.

851,देवीपुराणे सर्वे शिवाश्रमाः पुण्याः सर्वा नद्यः शुभप्रदाः ।,Devipurana states that all abodes of Shiva and all rivers are sacred places to perform dana.

This aspect has found many references in puranas and smritis. According to Vyasa smriti referred in Vachaspatyam
854,कुटुम्बभक्तवसनाद् देयं यदतिरिच्यते । अन्यथा दीयते यद्धि न तद् दानं फलप्रदम् ॥,Dana should only be made from money left over after fulfilling the requirements of the family as mentioned in Kurma Purana and Padma Purana.

However, in the story of Annadana by Unchavrttibrahmana, the brahmana's son says that those brahmanas who by tapas have gained victory over krodha and the senses and who have the ability to give away what they have wholeheartedly can find the door to svargaloka."

859,दातव्यमिति यद्दानं दीयतेऽनुपकारिणे । देशे काले च पात्रे च तद्दानं सात्विकं स्मृतम् ॥ यत्तु प्रत्युपकारार्थं फलमुद्दिश्य वा पुनः । दीयते च परिक्लिष्टं तद्दानं राजसं स्मृतम् ॥,": Sattvik dana is one that is made as a duty. It should be made after considering the time, place and the suitability of the receiver. The receiver should not perform any service or provide any benefit in return . Swami Ramsukhdas explains that this kind of dana is really tyaga, relinquishment, in which nothing is desired in return. This type of dana is not the kind that gives punya , merit in return. Seeking such punya will transform the dana into rajasik . The Bhagavad Gita expounds the satvika dana as follows:"
860,अदेशकाले यद्दानमपात्रेभ्यश्च दीयते । असत्कृतमवज्ञातं तत्तामसमुदाहृतम् ॥ दानं त्रिविधमित्येतत्कनिष्ठज्येष्ठमध्यमम् ॥ तत्र नैश्रेयसं ज्येष्ठं कनिष्ठं स्वार्थसिद्धये ॥ ॥ कारुण्यात्सर्वभूतेषु संविभागस्तु मध्यमः ॥,": When dana is made to an unsuitable person or without considering time or place, then it is called tamasika dana. If the dana is made without showing proper respect or in an insulting manner, then also it becomes tamasika. Another example of a tamasika dana would be where it is intended to cause bodily harm to another. In such a case, both the donor and the recipient are to be punished as for theft. The Bhagavad Gita says,"
861,नित्यं नैमित्तिकं काम्यं त्रिविधं दानमुच्यते । चतुर्थं विमलं प्रोक्तं सर्वदानोत्तमोत्तमम् ॥,"Based the objective of making a dana, it is classified into four categories:"

866,रागद्वेषविमुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन् । आत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति ॥ ॥,"The self-controlled man, whose mind can be subdued at will, free from forces of attraction and repulsion; mastered by the Self, attains prasadam, serenity, or self-poise."
867,ननु जीवन्मुक्तः कः ? यथा देहोऽहं पुरुषोऽहं ब्राह्मणोऽहं शूद्रोऽहमस्मीति दृढनिश्चयस्तथा नाहं ब्राह्मणः न शूद्रः न पुरुषः किन्तु असंगः सच्चिदानन्द स्वरूपः प्रकाशरूपः सर्वान्तर्यामी चिदाकाशरूपोऽस्मीति दृढनिश्चयरूपोऽपरोक्षज्ञानवान् जीवन्मुक्तः ॥,"In this serenity, all miseries pertaining to the body and the mind vanish, the misery of samsara ends. That man of renunciation, who, entirely abandoning all desires, goes through life content with the bare necessities of life, for the mere bodily existence, who is not proud of his knowledge,-such a man of steady knowledge, that man verily knows Brahman.
Tattavabodha mentions other characteristics of a Jivanmukta. In defining who a Jivanmukta is, Shri Shankaracharya states"
868,ज्ञातिभिर्वा नोपजन्ँ स्मरन्निदँ शरीरँ स यथा प्रयोग्य आचरणे युक्त एवमेवायमस्मिञ्छरीरे प्राणो युक्तः ॥ ॥,"The bodily activities of the knower of Brahman, from whom the apparent world has disappeared, is maintained, without his effort by the Supreme, as given in Chandogya Upanishad"

But the mind of the Jivanmukta does not react and so he does not see differences, but sees all forms only as Brahman. Shrimad Bhagavata Purana also says,"
870,ज्ञानभूमिः शुभेच्छाख्या प्रथमा समुदाहृता। विचारणा द्वितीया तु तृतीया तनुमानसा।। सत्वापत्तिश्चतुर्थी स्यात्ततोऽसंसक्तिनामिका। पदार्थाभावनी षष्ठी सप्तमी तुर्यगा स्मृता।।,"There are seven stages of Jnana that a Jivanmukta attains. It should be noted that these are psychological cognitive processes of importance to everyone. Vasishta Maharshi describes these stages thus,"
871,यं प्रव्रजन्तमनुपेतमपेतकृत्यं द्वैपायनो विरहकातर आजुहाव । पुत्रेति तन्मयतया तरवोऽभिनेदुः तं सर्वभूतहृदयं मुनिमानतोऽस्मि ॥ ॥ यः स्वानुभावमखिल श्रुतिसारमेकं अध्यात्मदीपं अतितितीर्षतां तमोऽन्धम् । संसारिणां करुणयाऽऽह पुराणगुह्यं तं व्याससूनुमुपयामि गुरुं मुनीनाम् ॥ ॥,"Shrimad Bhagavatam in the very second adhyaya praises the Brahmajnana-nishtatvam of Suka Mahamuni through the words of Suta Maharshi. Suta Muni mentions about Vyasa Maharshi's dissatisfaction about his son, Suka Mahamuni."

Since he thought of the deer while dying, he was born as a deer in his next life. The only difference was that he was born as a jatismara deer, that is, a deer that remembered the incidents of its past life. As a deer, Bharata left his mother and came again to Salagramakshetra because he remembered his old place. He lived on dry leaves and dry grass and lamented as he strayed from the path to realize the Atman due to attachment."

S. Apte. The traditional definition of the word tantra given in Sarvatantra siddhanta padarthalakshana sangraha by Bhikshu Gaurishankarais as follows"

877,धर्ममूलं वेदमाहुः ग्रन्थराशिमकृत्रिमम्। तद्विदां स्मृतिशीले च साध्वाचारं मनःप्रियम् ॥,"Many Sanatana Dharma texts proclaim that Vedas are the pramanas or basis of Dharma. These texts being the oldest in the world with no precedents to them, it is accepted with authority and respect by every follower of the concept of Dharma. Vyasa Maharshi's sayings stand testimony to the vedic authority of dharma as mentioned in Smrtichandrika as follows"
878,श्रौतस्त्रेताग्निसंबन्धात् स्मार्त्तः पूर्वं मयोदितः । श्रेयस्करतमः श्रौतस्तस्माच्छ्रौतं समाचरेत् ।।,"Kurma Purana describing what dharmas are to be followed mentions that Shrauta dharmas involving the tretagni are the most advisable followed by Smarta dharmas. When both Shruti and Smrti texts are unavailable , Shistachara forms the third kind of dharma that is taken as standard for enforcing dharma."
879,उभावभिहितौ धर्मौ वेदवेदविनिःसृतौ । शिष्टाचारस्तृतीयः स्याच्छ्रतिस्मृत्योरलाभतः ।।,Thus it is to be noted that Shistachara is also one source of knowing dharma that is to be followed in particular situations when the same cannot be understood from the vedic and smrti texts.
880,धर्मेणाधिगतो यैस्तु वेदः सपरिबृंहणः । ते शिष्टा ब्राह्मणाः प्रोक्ता नित्यमात्मगुणान्विताः ।।,"Shistaachara means the aachara of a Shista. It is founded in turn on Shrutis and Smrtis . Kurma Purana and Manu define who a or a person of virtuous conduct is, as follows"
881,तेषामभिमतो यः स्याच्चेतसा नित्यमेव हि । स धर्मः कथितः सद्भिर्नान्येषामिति धारणा ।।,"One who is knowledgeable in the dharmik concepts given in Vedas and Paribhrimhanas , and who is filled with Atmagunas engrossed in pursuing the knowledge of Brahman is called Shista . It is laid down that the views held by these Shistas, which are ever present in their Antakarana , are called Dharma by scholarly people and do not constitute the views of those who live otherwise."
882,शिष्टाः खलु विगतमत्सरा निरहंकाराः कुम्भीधान्या अलोलुपा दम्भदर्पलोभमोहक्रोधविवर्जिताः ॥ धर्मेणाधिगतो येषां वेदः सपरिबृंहणः । शिष्टास् तदनुमानज्ञाः श्रुतिप्रत्यक्षहेतवः ॥ इति ॥,Baudhayana Dharmasutras gives elaborate details about who is called a Shista and what his Atma and Buddhi gunas are.
883,धर्मेणाधिगतो यैस्तु वेदः सपरिबृंहणः । ते शिष्टा ब्राह्मणा ज्ञेयाः श्रुतिप्रत्यक्षहेतवः । । ।,"Shistas are devoid of matsarya , ahamkara , hypocrisy, arrogance, greed, moha , anger, they are content and have few desires. They have a though understanding of the Vedas and associated granthas like puranas and itihasas, who can clearly envisage the reasoning that ""this shruti is directly pertinent to this dharma"" , and are experts at pointing out the inferential references of Vedas in Smrtis, acharas, agamas . Thus he is one who, having understood the dharmas defined by the shastras, applies and executes them as per situations .
Manusmrti reiterates the importance of Shistas and their exceptional qualities."

885,कुशलाचरितेनैषां इह स्वार्थो न विद्यते । विपर्ययेण वानर्थो निरहङ्‌कारिणां प्रभो ॥ ॥,"Transgressing the limits of dharma and over-adventurous acts are found to have been committed by mighty divine beings. But that does not amount to a blemish for those glorious beings, just as the fire having numerous flames . These acts should not be committed even mentally by those beings who are not divine. Such people meet with destruction just like a person, other than Rudra, who swallows the poison that arose by the churning of the ocean. The words of those having divine wisdom are irrefutably truth and authoritative but their actions may be emulated only at certain times. A prudent and intelligent person should follow the actions of such virtuous men only when consistent with their own personal precepts. Such authoritative persons who are devoid of ahamkara have no selfish ends as they work for the welfare of others and gain nothing by acting on the contrary."
886,धर्मज्ञसमयः प्रमाणं वेदाश्च। वेदाश्च,"According to Apastamba the acharas that are followed by a Dharmajna, who is one well-versed in dharmashastras, is also a pramana for dharma."
887,अनान्मातेषु धर्मेषु कथं स्यादिति चेद्भवेत् । यं शिष्टा ब्राह्णा भ्रूयुः स धर्मस्स्यादशाङ्केतः।। । ।,The people constituting the Parishad should have exceptional qualities described in the shastras. The concept of Vidvat Parishads led to modern day thesis defence in our education system wherein a thesis is evaluated by a panel of experts in that particular field. Formation of parishads has extended to other areas where a group of experts in any given field form the Parishad. Manu discusses this aspect as follows
888,तदभावे दशावरा परिषत्।,Yajnavalkya mentions that a Parishad could consist of lesser number of Shistas and among them even if one Atmajnani is present his decision is to be accepted and followed as dharma in matters of ambiguity.
889,चत्वारो वेदधर्मज्ञाः परिषत्रैविद्यमेव वा। सा ब्रूते यं स धर्मस्स्यादेको वाऽध्यात्मवित्तमः।।,Yajnavalkya mentions that a Parishad could consist of lesser number of Shistas and among them even if one Atmajnani is present his decision is to be accepted and followed as dharma in matters of ambiguity.
890,वेदाः प्रमाणं स्मृतयः प्रमाणं धर्मार्थयुक्तं वचनं प्रमाणम्। यस्य प्रमाणं न भवेत्प्रमाणं न तस्य कुर्याद्वचनं प्रमाणम्।।,"Summary: Vedas, smrtis and the advices of dharma and artha are pramanas. Those whose pramanas do not include any of the above pramanas such a persons words are not to be considered as having any basis or pramanas, and hence should be ignored."
891,तथा सम्प्रदायोऽपि कचित्प्रमाणमित्याह मनुः। स्वकुलपरम्परायात आचारः सम्प्रदायः। सोऽपि शास्त्रविप्रतिपत्तौ द्रष्टव्यः।,"Along with the above Dharma pramanas, Sampradaya also has been considered as pramana in some instances according to Manu. Sampradaya is defined as those aacharas that have come down traditionally in ones own community/family. Where there are differences in aacharas according to shastras, that particular sampradaya has to be followed."
892,न मेऽन्यत्र क्षत्रियाया मनो जातु प्रवर्तते। ऋषिपुत्रीषु चान्यासु नावरासु परासु च।।,"A good example of Atma pramana is seen in Mahabharata in the Adi Parva, when Dushyanta speaks about his inner conscience advising him that it was not against his dharma to make an offer of marriage to Shakuntala, at Kanva Maharshi's ashram, even though he does not know her lineage."
893,तस्मात्प्रणिहितात्मानं विद्दि मां कलभाषिणि। यस्यां मे त्वयि भावोऽस्ति क्षत्रिया ह्यसि का वदा।।,"Dushyanta, while on a hunting trip visits the Kanva ashram one day. There, he comes across an exquisitely beautiful Shakuntala and is immediately attracted to her beauty. Dushyanta had never seen a maiden of such grace, charm and beauty. He comes to know that she is a hermit girl. Realizing that he has lost his heart to her, he is intrigued by the thought as to how he can fall in love with a sage's daughter. He enquires about her and finds out that she is born to Vishwamitra, a Kshatriya, and Menaka and comes to know that she is indeed a Kshatriya-girl. He is elated about the fact that even his heart did not fail him in performing the dharma or the righteous act and since Shakuntala is a Kshatriya-girl, he was not wrong in losing his heart to her."
894,स्मृतिः प्रत्यक्षमैतिह्यम् । अनुमानश्चतुष्टयम् ।,"Pramanas are in a way standards for examination, verification, modification and confirmation of our knowledge. A mention of Pramanas is made in the Taittriya Aranyaka as follows"

Since all the fundamental aspects of cognition are explained in this shastra sutras from Nyaya are taken as a standard. Vatsyayana Bhashya of Nyayasutras defines the 4 components as follows
896,यथा रजते इदं रजतमिति ज्ञानम्। सैव प्रमेच्युते ॥॥,"Similar to Nyaya, Annambhatta's Tarkasangraha explains that Yatartha Jnana is Prama. It clearly defines the difference between Prama and Aprama as followsSummary: Thus Prama is that which pertains to definite knowledge of an object which is true presentational in character, just as the knowledge an object of silver as ""this is silver"". Here the knowledge about the quality of silverness of the object is in toto without any distortion to silver."
897,प्रमाणमनुभूतिः सा स्मृतेरन्या न सा स्मृतिः । न प्रमाणं स्मृतिः पूर्वप्रतिपत्तिव्यपेक्षणात्।,"Prabhakara Mimamsa: They define prama or valid knowledge as immediate experience . It is different from smrti or memory which is the impression of past experiences. That is to say 'valid cognition' is Apprehension. Hence according to them the truth of knowledge, praamaanya is guaranteed by its having the characteristic of immediacy."

908,अहमस्मि प्रथमजा ऋतस्य । पूर्वं देवेभ्यो अमृतस्य नाभिः । यो मा ददाति स इदेव माऽऽवाः । अहमन्नमन्नमदन्तमद्मि ।,"In the Taittriya Brahmana of the Krishna yajurveda we hear annadevata, the devata residing in food, himself speaking about the importance of food and of the inviolability of the discipline of giving before eating, in words that are often reminiscent of the teachings of Bhiksu Angirasa. The eighth anuvaka of the eighth prapathaka of the second astaka of the brahmana quotes the annadevata proclaiming thus:"
909,अन्नं प्राणमन्नमपानमाहुः । अन्नं मृत्युं तमु जीवातुमाहुः । अन्नं ब्रह्माणो जरसं वदन्ति । अन्नमाहुः प्रजननं प्रजानाम् ।,"I, the annadevata, am the first progenitor of yajna: the first yajna born of me. It is I who, at the earliest times, become the nucleus of amrta for the devas. The one who gives me is in fact the one who obtains me. On the other hand, the one who does not give is consumed by me. I am the annadevata, I eat the one who does not give anna."
910,भोजयेच्छ्वभ्यः श्वपचेभ्यश्च वयोभ्यश्चावपेद्भूमाविति नानवत्तमश्नीयान्नैको न पूर्वं । तदप्येतदृचोक्तं मोघमन्नं विन्दते अप्रचेता इति,"In Bhutayajna, bali is to be offered not into fire but on the ground, which is wiped and cooked food is placed on it. These directions to give food even to outcasts, dogs and birds were the outcome of the noble sentiment of universal kindliness and charity, the idea that One Spirit pervades and illumines the even the meanest of creatures and binds all together. Shankhayana Grhyasutras winds up its vaisvadeva section with this fine exhortation:"
911,मोघमन्नं विन्दते अप्रचेताः सत्यं ब्रवीमि वध इत्स तस्य । नार्यमणं पुष्यति नो सखायं केवलाघो भवति केवलादी ॥,"Let him throw food to dogs, to svapachas , to birds on the ground; let him eat nothing without having cut off a portion ; let him not eat alone, nor before others since the Rig Veda mantra says ""the fool gets food in vain"""
912,अभ्यागतो ज्ञातपूर्वो ह्यज्ञातोऽतिथिरुच्यते।,"In the Mahabharata, Srikrishna, while advising Yudhisthira on the discipline of annadana, emphasizes this fundamental distinction between a guest who is already acquainted and the one who comes unknown and uninvited. The former, Srikrishna says, is called abhyagata , the latter alone is an atithi"
913,अप्रणोद्योऽतिथिः सायं सूर्योढो गृहमेधिना । काले प्राप्तस्त्वकाले वा नास्यानश्नन्गृहे वसेत् । ।,"A grhastha, of course, must offer reverential hospitality to both the abhyagata and the atithi. But it is the feeding of the atithi that forms an essential component of manusyayajna or Nru Yajna. The abhyagata is like a member of the household and, as Manu would explain later, he eats after the atithis, along with the family of the host.
The coming of an unknown, uninvited and unexpected atithi in the evening, Manu says, is like a fortune fetched to the householder's door by the setting sun himself. Such an atithi should be cared for with the greatest reverence. As Manusmrti puts it:"
914,सर्वेष्वेवाजस्रा अग्नयः स्युः अग्निपूजा च नित्या यथा गृहमेधे आवसथे श्रोत्रियावरार्ध्यानतिथीन्वासयेत् तेषां यथागुणमावसथाः शय्यान्नपानं च विदेयम्,"Apastamba dharmasutra , in fact, begins its discussion on rajadharma with what reads like a prescription for the installation of the king as a great grhastha."
915,अभृतानां भवेद्भर्ता भृतानामन्ववेक्षकः।,"Let the agni, the household-fire, burn unceasingly at all places: the vesma, the avasatha and the sabha. To all the three agnis, offer reverential worship everyday, in the manner prescribed for a grhastha. In the avasatha offer hospitality to all atithis, all those who come, beginning with the srotriyas, the ones who are well read in the vedas. To them, the atithis in the avasatha, offer proper room, bed and food, and let the offerings be appropriate to the accomplishments of each.
The king being essentially a great grhastha, he shares as it were in the papa of all grhasthas who eat without having first fed the hungry. Thus says Bhishma, to Yudhisthira in the Shantiparva or"
916,संविभागो हि भूतानां सर्वेषामेव दृश्यते। तथैवापचमानेभ्यः प्रदेयं गृहमेधिना॥,"Be the provider of the unprovided. And carefully look after those who happen to be in your care.
The Mahabharata, Vanaparva documents when Yudhisthira is seen feeling sorry about the loss of his kingdom. And the loss he laments is not of the power and prestige of kingship, but of the resources necessary for looking after others. He shares his grief with Rishi Saunaka that bound by the discipline of grhastha ashrama, he should fail to provide for even his followers. Then he goes on to define the duties of the king as a grhastha:"
917,ददस्वान्नं ददस्वान्नं ददस्वान्नं युधिष्ठिर ।।,"The Bhavishyapurana recounts the conversation between Srikrishna and Yudhisthira at the culmination of Asvamedha yajna after the war, in Mahabharata.""Give food! Give food! Give food! oh Yudhisthira"". Thus spake Srikrishna to Yudhisthira, while advising him on annadana, the discipline of giving, in the Bhavishyapurana. Parva 4 adhyaya 169 is dedicated to 
Srikrishna here recalls that even Srirama, during his days in the forest, had to run around in search of food. While thus searching for food, he along with his brother, Lakshmana, had to live in want. And he concludes that it must be because of their not having sufficiently given of food earlier . Srirama says"

Sri Varaha says that long ago a similar request was made by Raja Shveta to Vashistha maharshi, to which the reply was"

This attitude is enshrined in the most basic of Bharat's texts. Thus, the Taittriyopanishad advises in its resounding verses:"

922,अन्नेन धार्यते सर्वं जगदेतच्चराचरम्। अन्नात्प्रभवति प्राणः प्रत्यक्षं नास्ति संशयः॥,"The world, both animate and inanimate, is sustained by food. Life arises from food: this is observed all around, and there can be no doubt about it. Therefore, one who wishes to attain well-being in this world and beyond should offer food to all who seek. One should give food in accordance with time and place, and should keep giving to the limits of one's capacity, even if it were to cause inconvenience to one's own family. Finding an old person, a child, a tired traveler or a venerable one at the door, a householder should offer him worshipful hospitality, with gladness in his heart, as he would to his own teacher. Desirous of well-being beyond this world, the householder should purge himself of all anger, all jealousy, and offer worshipful hospitality, with grace and courtesy, to the one who appears at the door. Never offer slight to a person appearing at your door, never let a falsehood escape from your lips in his presence, and never ever ask him about his lineage or learning. The one who appears at the door at the proper time, even if he were an outcaste or such a one as partakes of the flesh of dog, deserves to be worshipped with the offering of food by him who seeks well-being beyond this world."

Indra sends the divine mother of dogs Sarama in search of the lost cows. In this context Sarama comes across Panis, with whom she has an important discussion. This episode describes how Sarama requests Panis to return back the cows and they in turn try to bribe or tempt her. Their conversation goes thus:"

This is a difficult path and there is the river rasa right in the middle of the road. How did you cross the river and why did you make the effort? Why have you come here?"

The cow wealth are our treasure and I came here looking for them. The river gave way to us in fear as it knew that if it didnt we would take over it."

If you have so much power, imagine how much powerful your master Indra must be? We should befriend Sarama. Let Indra become the master of cows."

931,तां जघान तदा क्रुद्ध उद्गिरन्तौ पयस्ततः जगाम सा भयोद्विग्ना पुनरेव पणान् प्रति,Sarama became very fearful and in her fear she walked towards the place of Panis. Indra who had followed Sarama on his Ari vahana killed all the panis and brought back the cows.

But unlike Rig veda, devatas first send Suparna to find the stolen cows. Suparna accepts bribe from the Panis and returns back to Indra. Enraged they strangle Suparna, who vomits the curds which he receives as bribe from Panis. Then they send Sarama, who returns to Indra with the information of the cows."

935,तस्या भर्तुरभिचार उक्तं प्रायश्चित्तं रहस्येषु,"Alternately, the reason might be that these texts were propounded by the rshis who resided in the forests and thought upon the secrets of theYajnas. Aranyakas describe the actions of life and also acquisition of knowledge. These works form the basis of theRahasya discussed in the Upanishads, therefore, another name of the Aranyakas was Rahasya as well. This name is mentioned in the Gopatha Brahmana and Manusmriti and Vasishta Dharmasutras."

Further, the Upanishad explains that the name and form arises from the Brahman in the following way"
943,छन्दांसि यज्ञाः क्रतवो व्रतानि भूतं भव्यं यच्च वेदा वदन्ति । अस्मान्मायी सृजते विश्वमेतत्तस्मिंश्चान्यो मायया सन्निरुद्धः ॥ ॥,"Ishvara by his Maya, creates, preserves and destroys the innumerable world systems that form the ocean of Samsara.As explained in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad"

The Ruler of Maya is Mayi projects this world. One should know that Nature is surely Maya and the Supreme Being is Mayi the ruler of Maya. This whole universe is verily pervaded by what are His limbs."
945,मयाऽध्यक्षेण प्रकृतिः सूयते सचराचरम्।,Shrimad Bhagavadgita further states that Prkrti is vested with the power of creation

Gunas are the constitutive elements of Prakrti or Pradhana. According to Samkhya siddhanta, Jagat is real and consists of 24 tattvas, namely Prakrti, Mahat, Ahamkara, Manas, the five Karmendriyas, five Jnanendriyas, the five tanmatras, and five panchabhutas. Purusha is neither like Prakrti or the evolutes like Buddhi or the Indriyas."

Just as, the thorns and branches are used for the protection of the sprout of the seed. If a person without adequate skills enters into a debate, he might not be able to come up with proper rejoinder at the right time to safeguard his thesis. In such a crisis, he may get away with such a tricky debate. In any case, if the opponent is not quick witted, the debater may gain some time to think of the proper reason. Thus, he may even win the debate and the sprout of his knowledge would be protected. In this way, Jalpa tactics may come in handy to a novice or an inexperienced debater. However, this justification was not altogether acceptable."
966,सः प्रतिपक्षस्थापनाहीनः वितण्डा ।।।।,"In other words, the debater here, tries to ensure his victory simply by refuting or demolishing the thesis put forward by the other side; by browbeating, misleading or ridiculing the opponent. The whole purpose of the exercise seems to be to prove the opponent wrong and incompetent, and to humiliate him. Therefore, the major part of Vitanda is spent in denying the opponents views, in discrediting him or in quarreling. Thus, there is no place for either valid knowledge or truth in such type of debate. In that sense, Vitanda is some what peculiar. Hence, Nyaya-Sutra describes Vitanda as,"
967,स्वपक्षरागेण चैके न्यायमतिवर्तन्ते तच । तत्त्वाध्यवसायसंरक्षणार्थं जल्पवितण्डे बीजप्ररोहसंरक्षणार्थं कण्टकशाखावरणवत् ॥ ॥,"Explaining the need for Jalpa and Vitanda, it is said in the Nyaya Sutras and the corresponding bhashya that,"

969,बुधजनैर्वादः परित्यज्यताम् ॥ ॥,"Samvada is generally understood as a dialogue between those like the teacher and the taught. Whereas, Vada refers to systematic establishment of a theory through logical reasoning in a cordial manner. While, the use of negation techniques as in Jalpa and Vitanda, transform a discourse into Vivada. In the 3rd verse of the Upadesha Panchaka, Adi Shankaracharya says,"
970,पक्षाभ्यां च मया गुप्तो जटायुर्न प्रदह्यते। प्रमादात्तत्र निर्दग्धः पतन्वायुपथादहम्।।।।,"Jatayu and his elder brother Sampati, once in an impetuous deed of rashly following the sun in his course flew up towards the sun. Jatayu outflew Sampati, and in the exuberance of youth entered Surya's orbit at noon time with the result that, due to the excessive heat his wings were scorched. In his attempt to shield Jatayu from the scorching heat of the Sun, Sampati flew up higher than Jatayu, and spread out his wings like an umbrella over Jatayu. Sampati's wings were burnt and fell down from the aerial heights on to Vindhya and Jatayu had fallen down somewhere near Janasthana."

It was at the time of killing of Vrtra by Indra, that Jatayu and Sampati made bets and flew up to the region of the Sun."

They could advance no further to the south. They were suffering from great hunger and thirst and if they returned with no tangible information about Sita, Sugriva would kill them. They preferred death by fasting on the seashore to death by the sword of Sugriva. Having decided thus the monkeys spread darbha grass on the extensive plain of Mahendra mountain and lay on the grass to die. In a large cave in the mountain was living Sampati."

Sampati relates the event to Hanuman, Jambavan and the monkey army.Summary: Once Suparshva goes out in search of food and stood blocking the entrance of Mount Mahendra. Obstructing many creatures, he observed a dark person carrying a lady whose brilliance was like that of the rising Sun. Resolving to seize them for food, he goes towards them, but the person courteously asked him to make way for him as he was blocking the aerial way. Thus having made way for him, he was greeted by the aerial bound creatures and they informed him that it was Ravanasura, the Asura Raja and the lady was Janakaputri whom he was forcibly carrying away."

When Yajnavalkya developed a desire to quit household life he called Maitreyi and while informing her of his decision told her before leaving ""I intend to divide the wealth between you and Katyayani and thereby end the relationship between you through me, your common husband."". Hearing this Maitreyi asks"

Existence of Pure Intelligence and again the absence of consciousness are not to be attributed to the same entity. Know that Self or Pure Intelligence is indestructible and indivisible. Wherever there is duality, one will experience impaired senses and judgments about the living beings. But one who experience Self, ""sees"" or perceives the all pervading unifying Universal consciousness in all forms of life thus wiping out any dualities. Thus, through what instrument should one know the Knower owing to which this Universe is known, and who else should know it?"

Aditya is the firewood, his Light rays are smoke in the fire, the Day is the flame, the Chandra is the embers and Nakshatras are the sparks.

Here, the descent to the intermediate stage between the physical world and the celestial realms is exquisitely connected through the world of parjanya or the clouds.

In this fire, Ap is transformed into the masculine form and power of speech. From this appears the garbha . This is the final stage and the Creation born of this fire - Prana stays within the garbha for nine or ten months, and after birth is encompassed by Jarayu until its life span. Before departing to paraloka, it returns to the same source that it was created from, i.e. Agni."

It is something which cannot fail to be known or perceived. It can be called as object of cognition but is mentioned separately, because Anumana and Shabda pramanas are both dependent upon it for only through a Drsthanta can they explained.

Pandavas after escaping death in Laksha grha, reach the banks of Ganga where in the tirtha of Utkocha, Devala along with Dhaumya had their ashrama and where doing tapas. Arjuna after defeating Chitraratha, a gandharva, was advised by him to approach Dhaumya for being their priest. Starting from that time Dhaumya remained as the purohita for Pandavas."

1029,शक्ररूपं स कृत्वा तु सर्वैर्देवगणैर्वृतः। सहस्राक्षस्तदा भूत्वा वज्रपाणिर्महायशाः॥,"But the mother felt very sorry because there was no milk. At last she mixed flour in water and made pudding and gave it to him. Upamanyu did not accept it. His mother told him that there was no way to get milk and that men could get wealth, crops etc. only by the grace of Siva. Upamanyu who was of a wilful nature performed severe tapas, first 100 divya years he lived on eating fruits, the next by eating dry leaves that have fallen on the ground, the third hundred just by drinking water. The next seven hundred years he performed tapas by living on air. Finally Siva appeared before him in the shape of Indra and told him to ask for his boon."

Aruni was also called Uddalaka, who is the father of Svetaketu and they both were given the knowledge of Panchagnividya by Pravahana Jaivali."

Finally unable to control the flow of water, he lay himself in the field where the embankment was required, and then the flow of water stopped. 
When he did not return to the ashrama, Dhaumya enquired about the whereabouts of Aruni, who was thus lying in the field. Dhaumya then goes in search of him to the fields and called out for him. On hearing his Guru's voice, Aruni comes out of the embankment by bursting it open and because of that Aruni got the name Uddalaka. He was blessed by his Guru that to be enlightened with the knowledge of all the vedas and dharmashastras."
1033,स उपाध्यायं प्रत्युवाच भो भैक्ष्येण वृत्तिं कल्पयामीति॥,Once Ayodhadhaumya asked Upamanyu to tend the cows. He used to take care of the animals grazing in the woods during daytime and return home at dusk and prostrate before the guru. Looking at the healthy body of Upamanyu the guru asked him how he was feeding himself. His reply was that he was earning his food by Bhiksha and feeding himself with what he got thus.

Hearing that Upamanyu used to offer the food he got to Dhaumya."

Finding Upamanyu even then as plump and healthy as he was formerly, the guru said: My son Upamanyu, you hand over to me all the food you get, and yet your body looks healthy. How are you maintaining yourself so?"" Upamanyu replied: ""After giving the alms I get first to you, my guru, I do again beg for alms and feed myself"". To this the guru reacted thus: My boy, what you do is not the proper thing. By the second course of alms-taking you stand in the way of other people getting their food. It is a greedy attitude"""
1036,स तैरर्कपत्रैर्भक्षितैः क्षारतिक्तकटुरूक्षैस्तीक्ष्णविपाकैश्चक्षुष्युपहतोऽन्धो बभूव॥ ततः सोऽन्धोऽपि चङ्क्रम्यमाणः कूपे पपात॥,"Upamanyu's reply was that he was feeding now-a-days on the foam of milk bristling at the mouth of the calves when they had fed on their mother's milk. And, the guru said: ""if that is so the calves will be, out of kindness and sympathy for you, releasing much foam of milk out of their mouths. That will affect them. So, do not repeat the process. Since the guru forbade him to have food in any manner as detailed above, Upamanyu, while tending the herd of cows in the forest, ate the bitter and poisonous leaves of Arka to satisfy his burning hunger. Arka being injurious to health in its properties, Upamanyu became blind. Moving about in this condition he fell into a neglected well in the woods."
1037,तमश्विनावाहतुः प्रीतौ स्वस्तवानया गुरुभक्त्या उपाध्यायस्य ते कार्ष्णायसा दन्ता भवतोऽपि हिरण्मया भविष्यन्ति चक्षुष्मांश्च भविष्यसीति श्रेयश्चावाप्स्यसीति॥,"When, even after the sun had set, Upamanyu did not, as usual, return, the guru enquired about him from other disciples. Naturally, they told the guru that Upamanyu was out in the forest with the cows. As the guru felt that Upamanyu was staying away late in the forest since he had been prevented from doing everything he went to the forest accompanied by other disciples and called out for Upamanyu, and Upamanyu responded from deep down the well. He also told the guru how he happened to fall into the well. After telling him that Dhaumya asked him to pray to the Asvinidevas to cure his blindness. Upamanyu, accordingly offered praises and prayed to the Asvinidevas, who were so pleased with him that they appeared before him and gave him a Apupas . Upamanyu refused to eat the bread without giving it to the guru. Then the Asvinidevas told him thus: ""In the past when we gave your guru a bread like this he ate the same without giving it to his guru. You may just imitate him and eat the apupas yourself"". Even then Upamanyu did not eat the them."

1053,वाक्यं स्याद्योग्यताकाङ्क्षासत्तियुक्तः पदोच्चयः ।,"Language is an instrument of communication of thought and the concept of Shabda is the very foundation of theories of language. They deal with the concepts pertaining to sound , its origin, qualities, relationship with listener and its validity as a pramana. Hence understanding a word and subsequent knowledge-from-word forms the basis of Shabdabodha. Shabda according to various texts broadly refer to meaningful ""words "", and their combination in the form of ""sentences "". While individual words have their meanings, the process through which the cognition of the sentence-meaning arises, involves processes such as yogyata akanksha , aasatti and tatparya . Alankarikas such as Vishvanatha have clearly defined a sentence as that group of words having yogyata, akanksha and aasatti."
1054,शब्दः अनुमानं अर्थस्य अनुपलब्धेः अनुमेयत्वात् ।। ,"Further, in the case of anumana, the hetu and the sadhya are related to each other. And from the cognition of the hetu, there arises the recollection of the relation between the hetu and the sadhya. Similarly in the case of Shabda too, the words constituting the shabda are related to their respective meanings. Then there arises the cognition of the sentence-meaning through the recollection of the relations between the words and their meanings after there arises the auditory perception of the shabda, i.e., vakya or statement. On this ground too, shabda is not a pramana distinct from anumana. Nyaya sutras explain this purvapaksha before going on to explain why it considers Shabda pramana as a distinct pramana."
1055,आप्तोपदेशः शब्दः।,Gautama in his Nyyastra defines sabda or verbal testimony as
1056,आप्तः खलु साक्षात्कृतधर्मा ।,The communication/assertion made by a reliable person is Shabda .
1057,आप्तोपदेशसामर्थ्यात्शब्दातर्थसम्प्रत्ययः ।। पूरणप्रदाहपाटनानुपलब्धेः च सम्बन्धाभावः ।।  ,"That person is called 'Apta', 'reliable' who possesses the direct and right knowledge of things . The word upadea etymologically means ""that"" through which something is communicated. And ""that"" is the sentence that gives rise to the cognition of something unknown hitherto.
In discussion about the connection between the word and the object signified by it, just as in inference there is a certain connection between the mark and the thing signified by it the purvapaksha lays down that shabdapramana and Anumana pramana are not any different. However, the uttarapaksha clarifies the differences therein. Summary: The connection between the word and object signified by it is not a natural one. While acknowledging that a word indicates a certain object, the object is not necessarily or naturally connected with the word. Hearing, for instance, the, word ""cow,"" we think of the animal signified by it, nevertheless the word and the animal are not connected with each other by nature or necessity. However, in case of inference the sign and the thing signified by it is natural and necessary and the basis for it is obvious to perception. In the case of verbal testimony, we rely on the unseen matter such as, celestial beings, saptadvipas, apsarasas etc signified by a word, because the word has been used by a reliable person. We accept them as realities not because they are known through words but because they are spoken of by persons who are reliable. Hence it is significant to note that Anumana is not based on Aptopadesha and is based on perception whereas in Shabdapramana the special point is to decide whether the sign comes from a reliable person."

Once he cheated a brahmana. Consequently all the brahmanas in that country cursed Romapada, left the place and emigrated to other lands. From that time there was no rain in the land of Anga. A severe drought ensued and famine followed causing great trouble to the people of the land."

She had a talk with Rshyashrnga in the course of which she used all the amorous enchantments to captivate the young Muni. She told him that she was the daughter of a muni, living in an ashrama, three yojanas away. Rshyashrnga felt a peculiar fascination for her and tried to please her by offering fruits etc. When she left him, he felt deeply distressed and unhappy. He was in that depressed and gloomy state of mind when Vibhandaka returned to the ashrama. Finding him unusually restless and dejected, the father asked him whether anyone had come there. Rshyashrnga who was an entire stranger to the feminine world told his father that a handsome youth of irresistible charm had visited him during Vibhandaka's absence."

But he could not guess who it was. On another occasion, the same woman came again to the ashrama in the absence of Vibhandaka. At her sight Rshyashrnga was enraptured and before his father's return, they left the ashrama. They entered the floating ashrama in the boat and the woman set the boat sailing in the river. It glided slowly down the river and at last reached near the palace of Romapada."

Still no children were born to them. He was much disappointed. At last he married again and brought Sumitra the princess of Kali. Of these three, Kausalya was the chief wife. Though he had three wives, Dasharatha still remained childless. The King and his queens spent their days in sorrow for a long time. The King remembered the curse he had incurred when he was young. The curse was that as they had died with sorrow at the death of their son Sravana, the same thing would happen to me. So he believed that sons would be born to him. He performed several devotional acts to get children. Finally he gave up all kingly pleasures and began to lead an ascetic life. He built a temple for his own use and consecrated the murti or vigraha of Mahavisnu in it. Then entrusting the administration of the Kingdom to his ministers he and his wives engaged themselves in daily devotion and meditation in the temple. ."

He says that the core of the discipline of a grhastha is in looking after and generously providing for the sustenance of all. Especially, of the guests who arrive at his door. And this opportunity to look after and sustain others is what makes the grhasthashrama so great that the severest austerities like tapas in cold water and in heat of summer during vanaprasthashrama cannot measure up to even the one-sixteenth part of the merit acquired by properly fulfilling the duties of the grhasthashrama."

1072,सर्वेषां अपि चैतेषां वेदस्मृतिविधानतः । गृहस्थ उच्यते श्रेष्ठः स त्रीनेतान्बिभर्ति हि । ,"The Manusmrti also iterates that among the brahmachari , grhastha , Vanaprasthi and the Sannyasi , the grhastha is declared to be the best as he supports the other three."

1075,मृगोष्ट्रखरमर्काखु सरीसृप्खगमक्षिकाः । आत्मनः पुत्रवत्पश्येत् तैरेषामन्तरं कियत् ॥,"Infact, the Bhagavata Purana emphasizes that a grhastha should look upon deers, camels, donkeys, monkeys, rats, serpents, birds and flies like one's own sons, for there is very little difference between them and one's offsprings. Implying that they must not be driven out of the house or fields if they enter and begin to eat."

He should approach her for conjugal pleasure at an appropriate time only. He should follow the instructions given in the shastras and defer from falsehood and deceit. He should eat in moderation, be diligent in the worship of the deities, exhibit gratitude towards those who help, speak the truth, have a soft disposition towards everyone, not be cruel towards anyone and always hold on to tolerance."
1077,शरीरमेकं दंपत्योर्विधात्रा पूर्वनिर्मितम्। तस्मात्स्वदारनिरतो ब्रह्मचारी विधीयते।।,"Elaborating on the virtue of being devoted to one's wife alone, the Mahabharata says,"
1078,एकेनांशेन धर्मार्थः कर्तव्यो हितमिच्छता। एकेनांशेन कामार्थमेकमंशं विवर्धयेत्।।,It is said that a householder should earn money by honest means and distribute it in the proper manner. He should spend one-tenth of his income in charity and enjoy sensual pleasures within the limits of the moral law. The Mahabharata while speaking of Pravrtti dharma for grhasthas states how wealth earned through rightful means should be utilised by dividing it into 3 portions.
1079,यावद् अर्थमुपासीनो देहे गेहे च पण्डितः । विरक्तो रक्तवत् तत्र नृलोके नरतां न्यसेत् ॥ दिव्यं भौमं चान्तरीक्षं वित्तं अच्युतनिर्मितम् । तत्सर्वं उपयुञ्जान एतत्कुर्यात् स्वतो बुधः ॥,"One should carry out one's duties while enjoying what one gets from the sky , from mines and accidentally by wind fall, as all wealth is created by Bhagavan Vishnu and is obtained through his grace."
1080,यावद् भ्रियेत जठरं तावत् स्वत्वं हि देहिनाम् । अधिकं योऽभिमन्येत स स्तेनो दण्डमर्हति ॥,"At the same time, the Bhagavata Purana also emphasizes that embodied beings can lay claim only to that much wealth as is necessary for filling one's stomach. And one who lays claims on the surplus is a thief and deserves punishment."
1081,दान्तो विधेयो हव्यकव्याप्रमत्तो ह्यन्नस्य दाता सततं द्विजेभ्यः। अमत्सरी सर्वलिङ्गप्रदाता वैताननित्यश्च गृहाश्रमी स्यात्।।,"The Mahabharata states that a grhasthashrami should control his indriyas and accept the instruction of the shastras, never fail to offer havya and kavya offering in honour of the devatas and pitrs respectively, always offer annadana to brahmanas, defer from jealousy and hatred, offer food to other ashramis and nourish them and always be engaged in yajnas and yagas."

And in order to expiate or remove the evils proceeding from their use as in smearing of the hearth, scraping of the grinding-stone and so forth, the great sages have ordained the performance of the Panchamahayajnas daily for the householders."
1085,स्वाध्यायेनार्चयेत र्षीन्होमैर्देवान्यथाविधि । पितॄञ् श्राद्धैश्च नॄनन्नैर्भूतानि बलिकर्मणा ।,"Hence, the Mahabharata states that a grhastha should purify his mind by performing the Panchamahayajnas. According to Manusmrti, a grhastha should worship the sages by Vedic studies, deities by the homa-offerings, the pitrs by shraddha offering, human beings by offering food and the elements by offering bali."
1086,पञ्चैतान्यो महाअयज्ञान्न हापयति शक्तितः । स गृहेऽपि वसन्नित्यं सूनादोषैर्न लिप्यते । देवतातिथिभृत्यानां पितॄणां आत्मनश्च यः । न निर्वपति पञ्चानां उच्छ्वसन्न स जीवति । स्वाध्याये नित्ययुक्तः स्याद्दैवे चैवेह कर्मणि । दैवकर्मणि युक्तो हि बिभर्तीदं चराचरम् ।,"The one who does not neglect these yajnas on any day, to the best of one's capacity, does not become tainted by the Papa of the slaughter-house, even though living in the householder's order. However, the one who does not make offerings to these five namely, the deities, guests, dependents, pitrus and himself does not live even though breathing. Hence, the Manusmrti states that one should be constantly engaged in Vedic study as also in acts in honour of the deities; for, one who is engaged in acts in honour of the deities upholds the world, moveable as well as immoveable."
1087,कृत्वैतद्बलिकर्मैवं अतिथिं पूर्वं आशयेत् । भिक्षां च भिक्षवे दद्याद्विधिवद्ब्रह्मचारिणे । यत्पुण्यफलं आप्नोति गां दत्त्वा विधिवद्गुरोः । तत्पुण्यफलं आप्नोति भिक्षां दत्त्वा द्विजो गृही ।,"The Manusmrti mentions that a grhastha should perform atithi satkara and give bhiksha to a sannyasi and brahmachari after the bali karma. For, the Punya one obtains by offering bhiksha to a sannyasi and brahmachari is equal to that of offering a cow to the guru."
1088,संप्राप्ताय त्वतिथये प्रदद्यादासनोदके । अन्नं चैव यथाशक्ति सत्कृत्य विधिपूर्वकम् । ,It also specifies how a grhastha should honour a guest.

1091,महर्षिपितृदेवानां गत्वानृण्यं यथाविधि । पुत्रे सर्वं समासज्य वसेन्माध्यस्थ्यं आश्रितः ।,"According to Manusmrti, when one has paid, according to the injunctions, one's debts to the great sages, to the forefathers, and to the deities, one should entrust everything to one's son and remain fixed in neutrality."
1092,एकाकी चिन्तयेन्नित्यं विविक्ते हितं आत्मनः । एकाकी चिन्तयानो हि परं श्रेयोऽधिगच्छति । ,"At this stage, one is advised to constantly meditate in solitude upon what is good for oneself. For, one who meditates in solitude attains the highest good."
1093,सत्सङ्‌गाच्छनकैः सङ्‌गं आत्मजायात्मजादिषु । विमुञ्चेन् मुच्यमानेषु स्वयं स्वप्नवदुत्थितः ॥,"Such companionship with good people helps one to gradually release oneself from attachment to oneself, one's wife, children etc. and rise above them like a person awakened from a dream."
1094,सिद्धैर्यज्ञावशिष्टार्थैः कल्पयेद् वृत्तिमात्मनः । शेषे स्वत्वं त्यजन् प्राज्ञः पदवीं महतामियात् ॥,"Moreover, it is also said that an intelligent person should consider the things obtained or the food left over from the offering to the deities in the Panchamahayajnas as one's means of livelihood. For, by this notion one can give up attachment to the body and the so-called proprietorship of the body. And when one is able to do this, then one becomes firmly fixed in the position of a great human being or mahatma."
1095,एषु स्नानं जपो होमो व्रतं देवद्विजार्चनम् । पितृदेवनृभूतेभ्यो यद् दत्तं तद्ध्यनश्वरम् ॥,"The Bhagavata Purana also enumerates a few occassions like the Sankrantis that are particularly considered as very auspicious times for humanity conducive to the attainment of prosperity and advices that if sufficiently rich, a dvija should perform according to one's means, the shraddha ie. Mahalaya in honour of one's departed parents as well as their kinsmen during these times. For, the performance of ablutions, japa, homa, observance of a vrata, worship of deities and brahmanas and gifts given in the names of pitrs, deities, men and living entities in general on these specific days, bear everlasting fruit."
1096,एतान्देशान् निषेवेत श्रेयस्कामो ह्यभीक्ष्णशः । धर्मो ह्यत्रेहितः पुंसां सहस्राधिफलोदयः ॥ ॥,"The text also enlists Punya Kshetras that enhance one's religious merits and mentions that one who is desirous of blessings, should constantly sojourn at these sacred-most spots where the murti or vigrahas of Hari are installed. For, righteous duties performed here with an intention to advance in one's spiritual journey, yield fruits thousand times more than what accrues at other places."
1097,एतान्देशान् निषेवेत श्रेयस्कामो ह्यभीक्ष्णशः । धर्मो ह्यत्रेहितः पुंसां सहस्राधिफलोदयः ॥,"At the same time, it also subtly emphasizes the need to love Shri Hari in the form of his creation for the fructification of one's worship. It says, some people with perfect devotion in the worship of Hari propitiate him thereby. But to some, the worship of Hari, even though performed, is not fruitful due to their hatred towards his creation."
1098,ये शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य यजन्ते श्रद्धयान्विताः । तेषां निष्ठा तु का कृष्ण सत्त्वमाहो रजस्तमः ॥,"To this, Shri Krishna replies that the shraddha of people could be either Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik in accordance with the basic nature of the person. And, conversely, as is the kind of shraddha, so develops the nature of the person. Thus, in all things like yajna, worship, charity, penance, etc., these qualities become expressed in accordance with the kind of shraddha in which the person concerned is based and they produce results in accordance with the quality of the doers shraddha."
1099,त्रिविधा भवति श्रद्धा देहिनां सा स्वभावजा । सात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति तां शृणु ॥,"The Bhagavad Gita explains the concept of Shraddha with respect to the Trigunas. It says that Shraddha of people that is born of their individual natures, is of three kinds viz. Sattviki, Rajasi and Tamasi characterized by sattva, rajas and tamas respectively."
1100,सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति भारत । श्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्धः स एव सः ॥,"The Bhagavad Gita emphasizes that the inherent qualities of ones mind mould ones Shraddha. And of whatever nature ones shraddha is, that the person personifies."
1101,सत्त्वं सुखे संजयति रजः कर्मणि भारत । ज्ञानमावृत्य तु तमः प्रमादे संजयत्युत ॥,"Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the inherent qualities in one's mind that mould one's shraddha. Each of these Trigunas has an inherent tendency. It is said,"
1102,यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः । न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम् ॥ तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ । ज्ञात्वा शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि ॥,"Chapter 16 of the Bhagavad Gita concludes with the statement that those who act under the impulse of desire by casting aside the ordinances of scriptures neither attain happiness nor the Supreme goal. And therefore, one must take scriptures as authoritative in determining the dos and donts and act accordingly."
1103,अशास्त्रविहितं घोरं तप्यन्ते ये तपो जनाः । दम्भाहंकारसंयुक्ताः कामरागबलान्विताः ॥ कर्षयन्तः शरीरस्थं भूतग्राममचेतसः । मां चैवान्तःशरीरस्थं तान्विद्ध्यासुरनिश्चयान् ॥,"This forms the basis for the discussion on Shraddha, its role in determining the basic nature of people, its influence on individual choices, etc. in the 17th chapter. Having enumerated the threefold typology of Shraddha based on the Trigunas, Shri Krishna now returns to the fundamental question that prompted the discussion ie. 'who are those who act in disobedience to Vedic scriptures'. To this, he answers,"
1104,आहारस्त्वपि सर्वस्य त्रिविधो भवति प्रियः । यज्ञस्तपस्तथा दानं तेषां भेदमिमं शृणु ॥,"It has already been indicated that one's Shraddha and inherent qualities play a determining role in one's choices. Since the nature of individuals is threefold ie. Sattvika, Rajasika and Tamasika, their consequent choices are also conceived as threefold in nature. The Bhagavad Gita states that even the food that is dear to all is of three kinds and the same is true in the case of Yajna, Tapa and Dana as well."
1105,ॐतत्सदिति निर्देशो ब्रह्मणस्त्रिविधः स्मृतः । ब्राह्मणास्तेन वेदाश्च यज्ञाश्च विहिताः पुरा ॥,"Having enumerated the threefold typology inherent in nature and choice, the Bhagavad Gita speaks of the three utterances that signify the Supreme Being, their importance and purpose in usage."
1106,तस्मादोमित्युदाहृत्य यज्ञदानतपःक्रियाः । प्रवर्तन्ते विधानोक्ताः सततं ब्रह्मवादिनाम् ॥ तदित्यनभिसन्धाय फलं यज्ञतपःक्रियाः । दानक्रियाश्च विविधाः क्रियन्ते मोक्षकाङ्क्षिभिः ॥ सद्भावे साधुभावे च सदित्येतत्प्रयुज्यते । प्रशस्ते कर्मणि तथा सच्छब्दः पार्थ युज्यते ॥ यज्ञे तपसि दाने च स्थितिः सदिति चोच्यते । कर्म चैव तदर्थीयं सदित्येवाभिधीयते ॥,"The word 'Sat' is used to denote reality and goodness; And is used for an auspicious action. Steadfastness in yajna, tapa and dana is also called Sat and so too is any action connected therewith."
1107,अश्रद्धया हुतं दत्तं तपस्तप्तं कृतं च यत् । असदित्युच्यते पार्थ न च तत्प्रेत्य नो इह ॥,"Following the explanation of ""Om Tat Sat"" as the medium and goal of actions, it is iterated that the absence of shraddha qualifies the action as 'Asat'. By corollary, it means that shraddha is the factor that facilitates the fruition of one's actions into being 'Sat' ie. good, auspicious and steadfast."
1108,स होवाच पितरं तत कस्मै मां दास्यसीति,Nachiketa aware of the evil results of an improperly conducted charity was impelled to take on the consequences and asks his father
1109,तवैव नाम्ना भवितायमग्निः सृङ्कां चेमामनेकरूपां गृहाण ॥,"Nachiketa's quest for knowledge of Agni or Brahman and Yama's revealing it is Paropakarakam for the welfare of all the mortal beings. Once the benefits of Agnichayanam and piling the fire thrice are known, people would be motivated to pursue it for their own good."
1110,त्रिणाचिकेतस्त्रिभिरेत्य सन्धिं त्रिकर्मकृत्तरति जन्ममृत्यू ।,"Pleased with Nachiketa's quest for brahmavidya, Yama grants that it will be celebrated with Nachiketa's name and blesses that those who perform Agnichayana will realize Atma by overcoming the cycles of birth and death. This shows that knowledge beyond the material world and for attainment of brahmajnana is the ultimate goal."
1111,यद्दुरन्गथ भवथि यछस्यम् भुतनि गछति,Several explanations are given by Yaska maharishi regarding the origin of the word cow/gau:
1112,पसुनमेहभवति यथस्म देव,that which is extensively pervasive and whence all the living entities are traveling on
1113,गवम्सुर्यह परो गुरुहु,"Aditya is also called gahu. Surya rash mi are also called as gau or cow.
The Vishnu Purana says"
1114,अत्रा गुरु शब्ध करनमचि,"when Lord Krishna appears, Bhudevi speaks to the devatas.
This is a significant part in the commentary. Vishnu chitta, an ancient acharya explains,"
1115,ननवर्नक्र्तिनि च,"One has to study this veda sutra to understand it. Rudra represents death . So the prayer: Let the light not see its end, offered to him indicates knowledge is limitless and the desire to have that is an eternal desire. Similarly when we see external cows, they have the same colour, different or same shape or light rays that take shelter of the power of Sun god could also have different colors. The janan surya is they have taken shelter of jnana bala and have different colors, the nature of jnana is necessarily not only one, it is varieties, therefore satya or truth has diverse facets and appears in different sizes and colours. As the Bhagavd Gita explains in 11th chapter"
1116,लोकाः समस्ताः सुखिनो भवन्तु ।,"Varna Vyavastha is a vision presented by dharma traditions wherein diversity is not only recognized as a fundamental reality of the human society, but is also made the foundation stone of human welfare. Dharma means that which upholds and hence, a social order based on the dharma should be such that it leads each individual to well-being and fulfillment, all the while establishing justice and harmony in the society, a notion well summarized in the popular saying"
1117,तद्यद्दूर्वा भवत्योषधीनामेवास्मिंस्तत्क्षत्रं दधात्यथो प्रतिष्ठामेतानि ह वै,Plants: Palasha tree is brahmana and durva is Kshatriya
1118,ऋग्भ्यो जातं वैश्यं वर्णमाहुः । यजुर्वेदं क्षत्रियस्याहुर्योनिम् । सामवेदो ब्राह्मणानां प्रसूतिः ।,"Vedas: In the Vedas, the Riks have been associated with Brahmanas, Yajus with Kshatriyas and Saman with Vaishyas according to some scholars. The Taitrriya Brahmana says that Brahman created the three varnas from the three Vedas - Vaishyas from Rigveda, Kshatriyas from Yajurveda, and Brahmanas from Samaveda."
1119,ब्रह्म वा इदमग्र आसीत्। एकमेव तदेकं सन्न व्यभवत्तच्छ्रेयो रूपमत्यसृजत क्षत्रं यान्येतानि देवत्रा क्षत्राणीन्द्रो वरुणः सोमो रुद्रः पर्जन्यो यमो मृत्युरीशान इति ।,"Vaidika Devatas: Shatapatha Brahmana reveals that Agni and Brhaspati were Brahmanas; Indra, Varuna, Soma, Rudra, Parjanya, and Yama were Kshatriyas; Vasu, Rudra, Aditya, Vaisvedevas and Maruts were Vaishyas and Pusha was Shudra."
1120,स शौद्रं वर्णमसृजत पूषणमियं वै पूषेयं हीदं सर्वं पुष्यति यदिदं किं च।,"Vaidika Svaras: Udaatta, Anudaatta, Svarita svaras of the vaidika mantra pronunciation are classified into varnas and rshis as per Yajnavalkya Shiksha shastra."

1122,स्वरास्तु ब्राह्मणा ज्ञेया वर्गाणां प्रथमाश्च ये द्वितीयाश्च तृतीयाश्च चतुर्थाश्चापि भूमिपाः,"Varnaksharamala: Even the alphabets have been classified under the varna vyavastha. Svara varnas are to be known as brahmana, of the five vargas consonant groups the first four of each group are to be known as belonging to Kshatriya varna, the panchama akshara of each group along with the Antasta are said to belong to the Vaishya group. Ushmana and Hakara group are said to be of the Shudra varna."
1123,वर्गाणां पञ्चमा वैश्या अन्तस्थाश्च तथैव च ऊष्माणश्च हकारश्च शूद्रा एव प्रकीर्तिताः,"Animals: Animals have been classified into groups; for example, goat has been supposed to be in the Brahmana varna Shatapatha Brahmana , horse is kshatriya , donkey is a vaishya and shudra as well."
1124,चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः। तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम्।।,"Each of the above thoughts have their arguments from various texts in support of and against them. There are various versions about the origin and number of the varnas. The primary introduction of the concept of Varna comes in the grandiose of Purusha Sukta in the Rigveda, where all Varnas are part of divine Supreme, a part of Vishvaroopa. Bhagavadgita's famous shloka declares Shrikrishna as the creator of the Varnas."
1125,ब्राह्मणोऽस्य मुखमासीद्बाहू राजन्यः कृतः । ऊरू तदस्य यद्वैश्यः पद्भ्यां शूद्रो अजायत ॥,"Though, varna system has often been understood as a reference to caste system or class system representing a social grouping, the primary usage of the term in the veda and dharmashastras has been that of a conceptual framework"". Rigveda Purushasukta provides an earliest reference to the conceptual framework of varna. It uses the metaphor of human body to represent the universe as a cosmic Purusha with his limbs denoting various aspects and functions of the universe."
1126,ब्रह्म वै स्वं महिमानं ब्राह्मणेष्वदधाद् अध्ययनअध्यापनयजनयाजनदानप्रतिग्रहसंयुक्तं वेदानां गुप्त्यै ॥,"Grhyasutras and Dharmasutras are the primary texts that describe the Varnashrama dharmas explicitly and are considered as ancient primary Kalpa texts that deal with this matter in great detail. While the Vedas mention them in particular context , Varnaashrama dharmas form the principal subject matter of these Vedanga texts. They laid strict rules regarding the occupations to be followed which was largely in a hereditary manner. Grhyasutras and Dharmasutras such as those of Baudhayana, Apastamba, Gautama, and Vashishta discuss the Varnadharmas with few differences, or with some peculiarity, omission or addition of principles. Here the Baudhayana Dharmasutras are mentioned as an example of the Varnadharmas along with the importance of svadharma of the people in the commentary."
1127,क्षत्रे बलम् अध्ययनयजनदानशस्त्रकोशभूतरक्षणसंयुक्तं क्षत्रस्य वृद्ध्यै ॥,"Associated with the Brahmanas are six Brahmana Dharmas which include adhyayana , adhyapana , performing yajnas , officiating yajnas giving danas and receiving danas - all for the sake of protection of Vedas."

1135,न योनिर्नापि संस्कारो न श्रुतं न च संततिः । कारणानि द्विजत्वस्य वृत्तमेव तु कारणम् ॥,"Mahabharata says, Neither birth, nor the purificatory rites, nor learning, nor offspring, can be regarded as grounds for conferring upon one the regenerate status. Verily, conduct is the only ground. All brahmanas in this world are brahmanas in consequence of conduct."
1136,ब्राह्मः स्वभावः सुश्रोणिः समः सर्वत्र मे मतिः । निर्गुणं निर्मलं ब्रह्म यत्र तिष्ठति स द्विजः ॥,"It further says, The status of Brahman, O auspicious lady, is equal wherever it exists. Even this is my opinion. He, indeed, is a brahmana in whom the status of Brahman exists,that condition which is bereft of attributes and which has no stain attached to it."
1137,श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुणः परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात् । स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेयः परधर्मो भयावहः ॥,"The relationship between svabhava and svadharma are those of cause and effect. But, in the specific case of Varna, in addition to its role as an effect, svadharma also reinforces the cause and ultimately helps an individual to transcend it. A person with kshatriya svabhava i.e. rajo gua, for example, will adopt a kshatriya life as his svadharma and will learn various kshatriya skills like fighting, waging wars, conducting administration etc., which will in-turn strengthen his kshatriya svabhava and plug any faults. Additionally, performance of kshatriya svadharma will also result in purity of mind, which would slowly change his rajo gua into sattva gua and hence make him competent for brahmaa svadharma. This transformation being a slow process may stretch over many lives. It is for this reason, Bhagavad Gita stresses performance of svadharma. It says,"
1138,एतैः कर्मफलैर्देवि न्यूनजातिकुलोद्भवः। शूद्रोऽप्यागमसम्पन्नो द्विजो भवति संस्कृतः ॥,"That is, while svabhava determines the svadharma of an individual, the performance of svadharma will transform the svabhava from its current condition to a higher condition. Therefore, as Sri Sachchidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswami says, The activities which can really help us in our present stage and lead us to a higher stage are known as svadharma. Because, as Sureshvaracharya notes From the performance of obligatory actions, righteousness arises. From the arising of righteousness, sins are destroyed and purity of mind ensues."
1139,नित्यकर्मानुष्ठानाद्धर्मोत्पत्तिर्धर्मोत्पत्तेः पापहानिस्ततश्चित्तशुद्धिः ।,"That is, while svabhava determines the svadharma of an individual, the performance of svadharma will transform the svabhava from its current condition to a higher condition. Therefore, as Sri Sachchidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswami says, The activities which can really help us in our present stage and lead us to a higher stage are known as svadharma. Because, as Sureshvaracharya notes From the performance of obligatory actions, righteousness arises. From the arising of righteousness, sins are destroyed and purity of mind ensues."
1140,ब्राह्मण्यं देवि दुष्प्रापं निसर्गात् ब्राह्मणः शुभे । क्षत्रियो वैश्यशूद्रौ वा निसर्गादिति मे मतिः ॥,"Mahabharata notes that people attain different varnas due to nature, i.e. inherent svabhava."
1141,एते योनिफला देवि स्थानभागनिदर्शकाः । स्वयं च वरदेनोक्ता ब्रह्मणा सृजता प्रजाः ॥,"After explaining how conduct and quality determines vara, it further notes that the distribution of varnas using birth is only for the sake of classification, i.e. birth was used only as easy reference to inner svabhava and hence, it is svabhava and not birth into a family, which is the real criteria for determining vara."
1142,कर्मभिः शुचिभिर्देवि शुद्धात्मा विजितेन्द्रियः । शूद्रोऽपि द्विजवत् सेव्य इति ब्रह्माब्रवीत् स्वयम् ॥,"Though, some like Sri Jnanananda Bharathi believe that birth in a particular family, caste, or community is an index of previous store of actions, which by themselves cannot be seen. Hence, birth in a particular family in itself determines vara. However, Mahabharata itself notes: Even a Shudra, O goddess, that has purified his soul by pure deeds and that has subjugated all his senses, deserves to be waited upon and served with reverence as a brahmaa. This has been said by the Self-born brahmaa himself. It further says in verse 50 that ""Neither birth, nor the purificatory rites, nor learning, nor offspring, can be regarded as grounds for conferring upon one the regenerate status. Shudra, if he is established on good conduct, is regarded as possessed of the status of a brahmaa. The status of Brahma, O auspicious lady, is equal wherever it exists."""
1143,स्वभावः कर्म च शुभं यत्र शूद्रोऽपि तिष्ठति । विशिष्टः स द्विजातेर्वै विज्ञेय इति मे मतिः ॥,"Similarly, Bhagavata Purana explicitly states that a persons svabhava must be the driving factor behind assignment of a particular vara to him, irrespective of the social class, he is born into."
1144,यस्य यल्लक्षणं प्रोक्तं पुंसो वर्णाभिव्यञ्जकम् । यदन्यत्रापि दृश्येत तत्तेनैव विनिर्दिशेत् ॥ ॥,"Similarly, Bhagavata Purana explicitly states that a persons svabhava must be the driving factor behind assignment of a particular vara to him, irrespective of the social class, he is born into."
1145,यस्य यल्लक्षणं प्रोक्तं पुंसो वर्णाभिव्यञ्जकम् । यदन्यत्रापि दृश्येत तत्तेनैव विनिर्दिशेत् ॥,"With gua and svabhava as the identifying factor, Sanatana dharma texts have created four conceptual categories: brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya and shudra. Adi Shankaracharya, while commenting on Bhagavad Gita says that brahmaa is a designation given to one in whom there is a predominance of sattva; kshatriya is one in whom there is both sattva and rajas, but rajas predominates; in vaishya, both rajas and tamas exist, but rajas predominates; and shudra is one in whom both rajas and tamas exist, but tamas predominates. These gunas are revealed by the natural temperaments and behavior exhibited by the person."
1146,अथवा ब्राह्मणस्वभावस्य सत्त्वगुणः प्रभवः कारणम् तथा क्षत्रियस्वभावस्य सत्त्वोपसर्जनं रजः प्रभवः वैश्यस्वभावस्य तमउपसर्जनं रजः प्रभवः शूद्रस्वभावस्य रजौपसर्जनं तमः प्रभवः प्रशान्त्यैश्वर्येहामूढतास्वभावदर्शनात् चतुर्णाम् ।,"Elaborating on this, Bhagavata Purana , lists what temperaments and behavior indicates what varna designation is to be assigned to a person. It says: the control of mind and senses, austerity, cleanliness, satisfaction, tolerance, simple straightforwardness, devotion to the divine, mercy, and truthfulness are the natural qualities of the brahmanas; dynamic power, bodily strength, determination, heroism, forbearance, generosity, great endeavor, steadiness, devotion to the brahmanas and leadership are the natural qualities of the kshatriyas; belief in the divine and Vedas, dedication to charity, freedom from hypocrisy, seva to the brahmanas and perpetually desiring to accumulate more money are the natural qualities of the vaishyas, seva without duplicity to others, cows and deities and complete satisfaction with whatever income is obtained in such seva, are the natural qualities of shudras."

But, this four-fold classification is essentially a conceptual classification based on four ideal svabhava conditions . For example, Manusmrti notes that there are only four vara and there is no fifth one."
1149,ब्राह्मणः क्षत्रियो वैश्यस्त्रयो वर्णा द्विजातयः । चतुर्थ एकजातिस्तु शूद्रो नास्ति तु पञ्चमः । ,Manusmti has further elaborated the duties for people having the four varna gunas thus.

1151,स्वे स्वे कर्मण्यभिरतः संसिद्धिं लभते नरः । स्वकर्मनिरतः सिद्धिं यथा विन्दति तच्छृणु ॥,"It is also clear that, contrary to popular understanding, varna does not refer to any particular vocation. Instead it provides guidelines of a general nature regarding suitable duties for people with different temperaments, which they can in-turn implement through choosing any of the vocations, which are in sync with their svadharma. A brahmaa vara person, for example, may be a teacher teaching wide range of subjects, or a priest at a temple, or a Rtvik, etc. who performs yajna, or a scholar in any of the vidyas. Similarly, a Shudra may well have been a painter, wood carver, architect, sculptor, labor, artisans, or in any other profession in the service industry. In other words, varna grouping is clearly a conceptual classification and has no direct connection to kulas or clan groupings based on trade and skills. Similarly, varna grouping is not related to ethno-cultural jati groupings or the colonial formulation of castes."

The Vedas also talk of bekanatas who are known to be shrewd money lenders who impose heavy interest for their profits. These bekanatas supposedly can see only during the day and when night befalls they argue that those visible things do not exist. Therefore they are considered to be nasthika or atheists like the Charvaka philosophers. To reaffirm this, Yaska maharshi quotes the following Rig mantra"
1156,वधीर्हि दस्युं धनिनं घनेनँ एकश्चरन्नुपशाकेभिरिन्द्र । धनोरधि विषुणक्ते व्यायन्नयज्वानः सनकाः प्रेतिमीयुः ॥,"In this section we see how Panis who were wealthy tradesmen developed enmity with Indra, the chief caretaker of the society. Panis referred to as Dasyus, held a prominent place in the society, accumulated fabulous wealth through extensive international trade and commerce. These Panis were also the ship builders traveling over the seas in search of trade centers, and materials for construction of ships navigated externsively along the Indian coasts and rivers. In the vedic economy, commercial production was in the hands of rest of the society and exchange was controlled by Panis, Dasyus, and Asuras who traded them."

1159,मासेभ्यः पितृलोकं पितृलोकादाकाशमाकाशाच्चन्द्रमसमेष सोमो राजा तद्देवानामन्नं तं देवा भक्षयन्ति ॥,"A logical question would be that if the dharmic rishis were Somarasa drunkards as insinuated by Western evangelists, the Rig veda would not eulogise Soma and the rishis would not have performed yajna while honouring Soma. If it was an alcoholic beverage, why would drinking it only be restricted to three times a day. Soma is not a ordinary beverage, it is the symbol of divinity and only the most qualified brahamanas were able to drink it, as concluded by the vedas."
1160,अपाम सोमममृता अभूमागन्म ज्योतिरविदाम देवान् । किं नूनमस्मान्कृणवदरातिः किमु धूर्तिरमृत मर्त्यस्य ॥,"The Sayana Bhashya claims that those who desire sexual appetite, should consider Somarasa as an intoxication and extract its juice through the chemical method and drink it. Such persons consider Somarasa as ordinary juice, but the wise Brahamanas and the rtvik yajamanas understood the real essence of . In other words, the soma is not some ordinary juice extracted from the creeper, but is critically important for attaining Brahmajnana as explained in the Vedas. Those who have actually honored the Soma, the brahamvadini, mahajnanis, those who are immersed in Brahman, explained the Soma differently;"

Precisely, the last week of the previous season and the the first week of the next season is such a transition period and it is called as Rutusandhi in Ayurveda. This time is considered crucial since one is expected to systematically switch from the regimen of previous season to that of the coming season. If done systematically as described in Ayurveda, one can maintain health even if the season changes. This is the period when most of the people fall sick and thus following the regime given in Ayurveda is the key to maintain immunity, health and wellbeing even during the season change."
1164,ऋत्वोरन्त्यादिसप्ताहावृतुसन्धिरिति स्मृतः तत्र पूर्वो विधिस्त्याज्यः सेवनीयोऽपरः क्रमात् असात्म्यजा हि रोगाः स्युः सहसा त्यागशीलनात्,Rutusandhi is the period between two adjacent rutus. Specifically last 7 days of the preceding rutu and the first 7 days of the upcoming rutu.
1165,यद् ऋत्वियाद् असृजत् तद् ऋतूनां ऋतुत्वम् ।,"It is that period when the climatic conditions of the previous season start changing and the new season starts lying its foundation. Therefore the weather in this period is changing or fluctuating. Due to the changing unstable climate, inner equilibrium of doshas also is affected and hence a person become more vulnerable to develop different diseases. These are counted under the seasonal flu or allergies in western medicine. Ayurveda has advised to adopt to the regime of both the seasons moderately and switch from one to the other gradually in order to prevent the diseases developing out of sudden changes in diet and activities known as 'Asatmyaja rogas'. One can find various references in Brahmanas of Yajnas suggested in Rutusandhi period to maintain health.In Gopatha Brahmana there is a sutra which states that, maximum diseases occur in the Rutusandhi period thus, maximum Yajnas are performed during the Rutusandhi period."

1170,दैवमात्मकृतं विद्यात् कर्म यत् पौर्वदैहिकम् स्मृतः पुरुषकारस्तु क्रियते यदिहापरम्,"Both Adharma and Asat Karma involve various activities of an individual or a group of individuals that are annoying and hurting to others. As this chain of Adharma and Asat karma continues, unrighteousness takes hand over the righteousness. Nature and environment get affected and this results in derangement of natural elements, occurrence of calamities, catastrophes, wars etc which take a toll on lives of many at a time. Ayurveda infers that the life span of individuals depends on Daiva as well as Purushakara . Here Daiva is the term used to denote the effects of deeds of past life and Purushakara indicates the effects of Karmas of present life. Acharya Charaka says,"
1171,सुखाद्युपलब्धिसाधनमिन्द्रियं मनः। तच्च प्रत्यात्मनियतत्वादनन्तं परमाणुरूपं नित्यं च॥,"Ayurveda accepts philosophical foundations fromDarshanaShastras to large extent but within its scope and area of application.Vaisheshikadarshanam has described Manas as one of the 9 dravyas .Dravyas are the eternal substances and seat for the gunas , the presence of which can be appraised by various means of knowledge. Thus Manas is considered as Dravya by Darshanas. Further Vaisheshikas describe Manas as Nityam , Anu and partless i.e. unlike other substances it does not give rise to more complex substances."

It also has critical role in the process of gaining knowledge of all types. In close association with Indriyas, Buddhi and Atman it is responsible for gaining knowledge obtained by Jnanendriyas by generating a stimulus. Acharya Charaka has described the artha and function of Manas as follow"

Skewed association of mind and senses by their deficient, excess or inappropriate engagement in perceiving their respective objects leads to development of abnormalities in mind, sensory organs and the intellect developed due to their union. This results in various abnormalities of Manas and Indriyas."

It perceives things when it is associated with the mind, intellect and sense faculties. If these instruments of perception are either absent or impeded, then there will be no perception. One cannot get the true reflection of an image from a mirror that is covered with dirt or from dirty water. Similar is the case when the mind gets afflicted."

1179,यदा ह्यस्मिञ् शरीरे धातवो वैषम्यमापद्यन्ते तदा क्लेशं विनाशं वा प्राप्नोति,"Ayurveda has given utmost importance to maintaining the equilibrium of 3 components viz. Dosha , Dhatu & Malas . It is said that, when these constituents are in equilibrium, the individual is healthy thus, all of them are called Dhatus in this state. On the other hand, when these 3 components fail to maintain equilibrium then there is either discomfort or destruction of the body."

Being the essence and the purest form of all 7 types of body tissues, it represents overall strength of the body and thus it is also referred to as the 'Balam' or strength of the body. While describing the nature and other properties of Ojus, Acharya Sushruta has stated that, If this Ojus is depleted it causes degeneration of the Shariram."
1181,सर्वे शरीरदोषा भवन्ति ग्राम्याहारात्।,"Acharya Charaka has made a clear statement that, any type of ill health can be rooted in use of Gramya ahara and vihara."

ThoughManasis a separate entity in the union of Ayu, it is also counted under Indriyas since it has a capacity to gain knowledge independently and it is only when Manas in united with a particular Indriya it can capture and transfer stimulus from object in outside world. Moreover, one can not perform any voluntary action physical or verbal in response to knowledge gained from outside stimulus, if Manas is not united with motor organ at that point of time. It is the important link between Atman and Indriyas in the process of gaining any kind of knowledge."
1183,सेन्द्रियं चेतनं द्रव्यं निरिन्द्रियमचेतनम्,"All the objects can be classified as animate and inanimate. The basis for this classification is not presence or absence ofatman in specific objects. Because atma is described as vibhu . But the presence of atman is manifested through sense organs.

1184,तद्ध्यनुतिष्ठन् युगपत् सम्पादयत्यर्थद्वयमारोग्यमिन्द्रियविजयं चेति,"Acharya Charaka has highlighted the importance of following Sadvrtta. He says that if followed religiously, Sadvrutta helps to conquer Indriyas, indicating control over senses and desires. Control over Indriyas confers prevention from diseases caused due to their excess, deficient or abnormal involvement in their objects of focus. This ultimately helps to prevent various diseases"

This union is present till the time of death or in other words death is the discontinuation of this union. Therefore Shareeram, Indriyas, Satva and Atma are considered the essential components of Life."
1187,हिताहितं सुखं दुःखम् आयुस् तस्य हिताहितम् । मानं च तच्च यत्रोक्तम् आयुर्वेदः स उच्यते ।।,"Acharya Charaka defines Ayurveda as, the Veda which offers knowledge about Ayu, its measurement, various aspects of Ayu like Hitayu , Ahitayu , Sukhayu and Dukhhayu , in addition to, the knowledge of factors acting as promoters and non-promoters of these types of Ayu."
1188,धर्मार्थकाममोक्षाणामारोग्यं मूलम् उत्तमम् ।। रोगास्तस्यापहर्तारः श्रेयसो जीवितस्य च । प्रादुर्भूतो मनुष्याणामन्तरायो महानयम् ।।,"Acharya Charaka throws a light on this by writing that, Arogya acts as the root of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mokshawhich results in Shreyas and Jivitam . Through the fulfillment of these, life becomes complete socially, physically, psychologically, intellectually, and adhyatmikly.Therefore when in ancient times, common people, Seers and sages performing pious acts experienced impediments in fulfilling these aspects of life due to disturbances caused by diseases, the quest for knowledge of life began.
