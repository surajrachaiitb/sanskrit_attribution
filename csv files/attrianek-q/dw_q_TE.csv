Such a person's speech (sa vāk) becomes as destructive as a thunderbolt (vajraḥ) to the one who sacrifices (yajamānaṃ hinasti). This is because, just like Prahlāda (indraśatruḥ), when acting with hostility (aparādhāt) towards it, can harm the mantra."

This has been observed to be the case with attributes and their respective means. The question arises, how can the transient 'anitya' (attribute) serve as the means for the eternal 'śabda' (word), just as it does for ātma and other objects?"

This is because of the reason that there is a distinction between the eternal nature of the term ""property"" (dharmaviśiṣṭaḥ śabdaḥ) and the transient nature of the property characterized by it (dharmaviśiṣṭaḥ dharmaḥ anityaḥ). This distinction is grasped through this very means (tadgrahaṇena). The property of that which is to be accomplished (sādhyasya) is twofold: a property characterized by the word ""property"" (dharmī), and a transient property (anityatvam). This illustrates that the term ""property"" has different meanings in different contexts, just like how the term 'light' can refer to both sunlight and the light of a lamp. Similarly, 'dharma' can refer to an eternal quality or a transient one based on the context (ihetaraṃ tadgrahaṇena gṛhyate)."

Moreover, what is donated with sincere faith, be it small, becomes inexhaustible for him. Here, 'satisfying the forefathers with ablutions' implies performing the ritualistic bathing of Pitrs during shraddha ceremony. The phrase 'partakes of them' indicates consuming sacred food (naivedya) offered to the ancestors. The text further highlights that even a small donation made with unwavering faith becomes boundless in its benefits for the giver."

In the absence of fire, a priest's life depends on it, and no ritual is performed without Darshapurnamasa. Revered by priests as Dvija, the fire isn't utilized for domestic or Paitryajna rituals. Akin to how life relies on breath, so does a priest's existence depend on the fire."

Then, after making the remnants of the offering while being fully focused, one should offer the concluding portion of the ritual facing south with the audaka (a specific type of water) as per the prescribed method, which is in front or before the eyes, and is like a town surrounded by water. This very fortune which is an oblation or burnt offering accompanied by a kind of perfume should be offered."

A domestic priest should inspire and encourage him, having fulfilled his duties, to cherish his own father as dear. Manu proclaimed, ""After invoking the name of the father, cause him to be extolled; whether it's your grandfather or great-grandfather, both should partake in that funeral rite."" If permitted, one may personally carry out the preferred rites."

Let him not use his foot to touch anything animate or inanimate, and nor should he bring distress to the spirit of the departed. His foot-touch is protective for those who are sinful and troubled, an evil-doer's harmful actions towards the pious and devoted."

He should make the subjects of discourse, such as narratives, precepts, history, and legends, as well as wholesome texts, delightful to the brahmins, satisfying them gradually. With food in a mystical sense (anna) and other primary means that are not obtained casually, he should uplift these qualities (guṇaiḥ) in himself, expressing fulness or high degree."

Who should provide a seat and where it should be arranged along with the lifted tilas (sesame seeds) is questioned. Here, three attributes are extolled as pure for the daughter's son during the Śrāddha: integrity, freedom from anger, and enthusiasm."

The duty of performing this rite oneself leads to being bound to it. This same duty is to be accomplished by the sons for offering pinda. The act of making offerings in the ritual, indicated by the past participle, connects one to its completion. The expressed Soma juice is also a part of this ritual."

At the conclusion of rites, 'sampannam' (completed) is considered fitting; even in the ritual for Pitrs, it should be referred to as 'svaditam'; in the divine assembly, 'rucitam' (pleasing to the mind) is appreciated."

Some, breathing the flute, consume the remains of the offerings, while others, engaging in enjoyment, hastily put or place anything on or in the fountain of digestive power or scatter them elsewhere."

The prosperous should also do likewise, without being excessively lavish. Proper conduct, place and time, and cleanliness are crucial in both cases. These five factors, when observed, lead to the destruction of obstacles. Therefore, never be overly elaborate in your actions."
729,ekamapyāśayedvipraṃ pitrarthe pāñcayajñike || ||,"Even in the case of a single domestic priest, should one cause (him) to stay as a guest during the five sacrificial rituals, for the welfare of a father personified as the son of Dharma and Buddhi?"

Those who are self-restrained and desire to eat should do so. Lest they become overheated, let them eat. The qualities of the oblation should not be discussed here. The ancestors will partake if its qualities have been declared. If one eats with a veiled face or consumes the southern portion, that act is protective. Indeed, you have eaten and thus will protect (them)."

Likewise, once the shared attribute of beans is realized through comparison between ""mudga"" (bean) and ""parni"" (its leaf), this recognition enables one to refer to black gram (""tamasah"") appropriately. Similarly, when the properties of ""māṣa"" (lentil) and its accompanying objects are understood through comparison, it allows for proper reference to similar things.

Ignorance, the cause of worldly existence, does not concern the true self, which is free from duality. The nature of bliss is not shared by the two aspects of Purusha. Happiness arising from eliminating suffering is a quality associated with the one who has realized this unity. Praiseworthy are those who understand this concept.

External objects depend on specific places, times, and distinct factors, manifesting differently to various sense organs and locations, even at separate moments or in diverse settings. The perception's scope is defined by the locus – be it the body's extremities or elsewhere. This encompasses experiences such as soaring through Gandharva city or entering a previously seen dwelling.

Such awareness is regarded as the cause of experienced objects, akin to perceiving mrigatoya being the cause of that substance. The sun's appearance stems from its own radiance and warmth. Even the concept of zero arises from the absence of any particular object.

Moreover, words like ""existence"" or ""non-existence,"" when fully realized, are considered mental constructs, despite their external reference. This understanding comes not only from direct experience but also from reasoning power. Perceived objects are deemed to exist due to their inherent nature and the causes that generate them, rather than relying on words or mental constructs alone.

In essence, this passage investigates the relationship between external objects, perception, and language, emphasizing ultimate reality can't be reduced to mere names or concepts but is rooted in direct experience and causality."

It is the grasping of the senses, the controlling of one's own actions, and the examination – all related to that very object of the senses and the faculty of sense. Assuredly, wholly regarding this, it is the authority, aversion, consideration, and investigation of the thinking soul."
