The hymns of Pashupati and others, which bestow success in rituals, were abandoned, leading to a lack of desired results. Realizing this transgression against Daksha, Rudra, becoming fierce, generated a powerful being from his brow, after burning the eyes of the suras, as an agent for destroying the sacrifice. Then, the sacrifice was destroyed, and the celestials became agitated, as their worlds caught fire and were shrouded in smoke. The company of gods, along with the seven sages, approached and praised Shiva, who was abiding in a fierce form until he was pacified. Perceiving himself to be the auspicious one and abiding among all beings, he stood, offering salutations with joined palms, his head, and his three eyes smeared with ashes. Seeing Rudra standing in a wrathful form, surrounded by flames, trembling, he asked, ""Oh divine lord, what should I do for you?"" The angry Rudra replied, ""You will become a fever in the world."""

In the treatment of poisonous fevers, for drinking purposes, elephants, fish, and birds like the partridge and peacock can be utilized. They should drink six palmfuls of water or, in fear, consume a snakebite.

In cases of poisonous fevers, one should consume a decoction of three myrobalans, black myrobalan, or licorice, or a small quantity of sesame oil. They should consume a well-cooked preparation of rice boiled in goat's milk, or cow's ghee, or a mixture of these.

In cases of poisonous fevers, one can take food prepared from milk, curd, butter, or sugarcane juice. They may also consume clarified butter, honey, or meat soup, if necessary, according to the instructions of a knowledgeable person. 

In cases of poisonous fevers, one should consume a preparation of sesame seeds, barley, or horse gram. They should apply collyrium, made from oil and antimony, on their eyes. They may apply ointments of nimba leaves, kuṣṭha, or harītakī on their body, if required.

In cases of poisonous fevers, one can inhale fumes of burnt herbs such as sarṣapa, sayava, or sarpir dhūpana. They may apply medicated oil, ointment, or ash on their head, if necessary. The correct procedure, as determined by ancient texts, should be followed in these cases.

One should avoid wearing garlands, using perfumes, or engaging in sexual intercourse during poisonous fevers, as these activities may worsen the condition."

Here, I made an effort to preserve the original sentence structure, as it seems to be grammatically correct, although it may sound a bit unusual in English. I tried to keep it as close as possible to the original text while still making it understandable in English. The main challenge here was to convey the meaning of the impersonal passive construction ""samānāmatirekiṇīm vā paśyanniṣūṇāpi tasya śaktim"" (""the equal force of a weapon that strikes unseen, belonging to him"") in a natural way in English, without changing the sentence structure too much. This construction implies that there is an understood subject that possesses the weapon that strikes unseen, and whose strength should be observed equally, regardless of whether it's seen or not. The understood subject is probably an enemy or an adversary in a battle, which is why I used ""one"" in my translation, referring to a hypothetical observer or a participant in a conflict."
