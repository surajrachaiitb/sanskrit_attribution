"Envoy of Yudhiṣṭhira told him, ""Duryodhana was aware of the happenings in his neighboring countries as well as in his country through his envoys.""",20
"Arjuna went to Mount Indrakila to satisfy Indra by austerities. Indra deputed some celestial nymphs to test his strength of character. The nymphs came back unsuccessful and testified to his self-restraint- both natural and adventitious -- the restraint which was his inborn quality and that acquired by him through his grudge against the enemies. Indra was, therefore, pleased with him and came to his hermitage to meet him.",298
"Indra presented himself in Arjuna's hermitage with an old and infirm body, but still his natural super-human appearance made the hermitage inspired with awe, the painful element of the fear caused by his majestic appearance being replaced by wonder. ",304
"Indra, in the disguise of the hermit, comments on the penance of the Arjuna like this: ""Doing penance for liberation is good in this mortal world, but your appearance is inappropriate.  So why is this armour worn by you?""",310-322
"Arjuna told Indra, ""Sir, you have made an ideal speech. Not a single word has been used in an unusual sense, and the sense intended is thus fully intelligible. Your words are vigorous but, at the same time, fully significant. They are not incoherent or ambiguous anywhere. The speech has not at all been lengthy and tiresome, but still, it leaves nothing untouched. It is fully expressive and explicit.""",335
"I am not a peaceful Brahmin-hermit but a fiery Kshatriya born of Pāṇḍu and Pṛthā. I am the same person who only the other day earned a fabulously large mass of wealth by conquering the Uttara-Kurus and obtained the significant name Dhanañjaya. I have preferred to be entirely at the command of my eldest brother who, being deprived of his kingdom by the kinsmen, asks me to practice austerities. I am thus practicing austerities not as an all-bearing recluse but as a regular house-holder with the clear object of achieving some particular end.",342
"The Shastras advise us to be at a safe distance from the falling bank of a river. For instance, if we frequent such a bank, we endanger our own life. Similar is the case with friendship with the wicked. Such friendship is suicidal. Our friendship with the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra has created their enmity towards us. The best course of conduct with reference to a wicked person is to avoid him by all means.",352
"Arjuna narrates the supremacy of lofty people to Indra: ""Even a lofty mountain huge on account of impenetrable forest can be got over, but the insurmountable character never quits a man of prowess, lofty with a sense of self-respect.""",360
"I am now just in the second stage, which has not yet been properly gone through. The task of destroying the enemies entrusted to me has not yet been done. My mother is not present here, so her permission is also unavailable. And I cannot disobey my king Yudhishthira who is not only my eldest brother but is virtuous to a degree. Disobedience to him will involve a triple sin. Under the circumstances I am not in a position to take up abruptly a higher stage of life as advised by you.",374
"‘Worship Śiva. Śiva being pleased, you will be endowed, by the other guardians of the eight directions together with myself, with prowess invincible in all the three worlds and will then be able to make the goddess of the prosperity of the enemies very much attached to you'- saying these words to Arjuna, Indra vanished.",378
